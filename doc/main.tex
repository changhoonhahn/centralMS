\section{Introduction}
\bitem 
\item Motivate why we think SF galaxies evolve along the main sequence  
\item Discuss the current thought process on galaxy assembly bias 
\item Explain the limitation of SFH derivable from observations (Claire's fisher matrix paper would be really good; ask her about the details) 
\item in fact we can't constrain sf variability very well even in simulations due to the time resolution (see \hahngmm).  
\item Observations also can't provide detail host dark matter halo properties
\item So the approach with combining observations with N-body (empirical modeling) is very effective in the context of the halo.
\item Maybe talk about how the bigger context of why this is important?  
\item Why only centrals -- because our current best understanding of satellites is that they quench after infall, so it doesn't make sense to look at them
\item our model goes from $z < 1$ because beyond that the observations are statistically meaningless.

\section{Central Galaxies of SDSS DR7} \label{sec:sdss}
We construct our galaxy sample following the sample selection of \cite{tinker2011}. 
We select a volume-limited sample of galaxies with $M_r −5 log(h) < −18$ and complete in
$M_* > 10^{9.4} M_\odot$ from the NYU Value-Added Galaxy Catalog \citep[VAGC;][]{blanton2005}
of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7~\citep[SDSS DR7;][]{abazajian2009} at 
$z \approx 0.04$. The stellar masses of these galaxies are estimated using the
$\mathtt{kcorrect}$ code~\citep{blanton2007} assuming a~\cite{chabrier2003} initial
mass function. The star formation of the galaxies are estimated spectroscopically using the
specific star formation rates (SSFR) from the current release of the MPA-JHU spectral 
reductions\footnote{http://wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/SDSS/DR7/}~\citep{brinchmann2004}.
Generally speaking, $\mathrm{SSFR} > 10^{-11}\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ are derived from 
$\mathrm{H}_\alpha$ emission, $10^{-11} > \mathrm{SSFR} > 10^{-12}\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$
are derived from a combination of emission lines, and $\mathrm{SSFR} < 10^{-12}\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$
are based on $D_n 4000$~\citep[see discussion in][]{wetzel2013}. We note that 
$\mathrm{SSFR} < 10^{-12}\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ should only be considered upper limits 
to the true galaxy SSFR~\citep{salim2007}.

From our galaxy sample, we identify the central galaxies using the \cite{tinker2011} halo-based 
group-finding algorithm, which is based on the~\cite{yang2005} algorithm and tested 
in~\cite{campbell2015}. The algorithm assigns a probability of being a satellite,
$P_\mathrm{sat}$, to each galaxy in the sample. Galaxies with $P_\mathrm{sat} \geq 0.5$ 
are classified as satellites and $P_\mathrm{sat} < 0.5$ are classified as centrals. 
In this paper we focus on central galaxies. With any group finding algorithm, galaxies are 
misassigned due to projection effects and redshift space distortions. The purity 
of the full central galaxy sample is $\sim 90\%$ with a completeness of $\sim 95\%$~\citep{tinker2017}.
Furthermore, \cite{campbell2015} find that the algorithm robustly identifies red and blue centrals
as a function of stellar mass, which is highly relevant to our analysis.  

In the left panel of Figure~\ref{fig:groupcat}, we plot the SFR-$M_*$ distribution of
the SDSS DR7 central galaxies. In the right panel, we plot the distribution of SSFR, 
$p(\log \mathrm{SSFR})$, for galaxies with $10.6 < \log \,M_* < 10.8$ (stellar mass range 
highlighted on the left panel). Both panels of Figure~\ref{fig:groupcat} illustrate the 
bimodality in the galaxy sample. The SFR-$M_*$ distribution also illustrate the correlation
between SFR and $M_*$ in star-forming galaxies \emph{i.e.} the star-formation main sequence 
(SFS).

\section{Model: Simulated Central Galaxies} \label{sec:sim}
We're interesting in constructing a model that tracks central galaxies and 
their star formation within the heirarchical growth of their host halos. This 
requires a cosmological $N$-body simulation that accounts for the complex 
dynamical processes that govern the host halos of galaxies. In this paper 
we use the high resolution $N$-body simulation from~\cite{wetzel2013} generated 
using the \cite{white2002} $\mathtt{TreePM}$ code with flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology 
($\Omega_m =0.274, \Omega_b = 0.0457, h = 0.7, n=0.95, \mathrm{and} \sigma_8 = 0.8$).
From initial conditions at $z = 150$ generated from second-order Lagrangian 
Perturbation Theory, $2048^3$ particles with mass of $1.98 \times 10^8\,M_\odot$ are 
evolved in a $250 \mathrm{Mpc}/h$ box with a Plummer equivalent smoothing of 
$2.5\,\mathrm{kpc}/h$. For a more detailed description of the simulation, we 
refer readers to~\cite{wetzel2013, wetzel2014}.

From the $\mathrm{TreePM}$ $N$-body simulation, `host halos' are identified 
using the Friends-of-Friends (FoF) algorithm of \cite{davis1985} with 
linking length of $b = 0.168$ times the mean inter-partcile spacing. Within 
these host halos, \cite{wetzel2013} identifies `subhalos' as overdensities 
in phase space through a six-dimensional FoF algorithm~\citep[FoF6D][]{white2010}. 
The host halos and subhalos are then tracked across the simulation outputs 
from $z = 10$ to $0$ to build merger trees~\citep{wetzel2009,wetzel2010}. 
The most massive subhalos in newly-formed host halos at a given simulation 
output are defined as the `central' subhalo. A central subhalo retains its 
`central' definition until it falls into a more massive host halo, at which 
point it becomes a `satellite' subhalo. 

At a given snapshot, we assign stellar masses used only for initializing
our model to each subhalo by subhalo abundance matching~\citep[SHAM;][]{conroy2006,vale2006,yang2009,wetzel2012,leja2013,wetzel2013,wetzel2014,hahn2017a}
to $M_\mathrm{peak}$, the maxmum host halo mass that it ever had as a 
central subhalo. SHAM, in its simplest form, assumes a one-to-one mapping 
between subhalo $M_\mathrm{peak}$ and galaxy stellar mass $M_*$ that 
preserves rank order: $n(> M_\mathrm{peak}) > n(> M_*)$. In practice, we 
apply a $0.2$ dex log-normal scatter in $M_∗$ at fixed $M_\mathrm{peak}$ 
based on the observed stellar to halo mass relation (SHMR; \todo{bunch of SMHMR citations}). %\cite{gu2016} compile empirical constraints on the scatter of this stellar mass to halo mass relation ($\sigma_{\log M_*}$). 
For $n(> M_*)$, we use observed stellar mass functions (SMFs) at the redshift 
corresponding to the snapshot. At $z=0.05$, the lowest redshift snapshot of 
our model, we use the SMF from \cite{li2009}, which is based on the same 
SDSS NYU-VAGC sample as our group catalog. At higher redshifts, we interpolate 
between the \cite{li2009} SMF and the SMF from \cite{marchesini2009} at 
$z = 1.6$. We choose the \cite{marchesini2009} SMF, among others, because it 
produces interpolated SMFs that monotonically increase at $z < 1$. As noted 
in \cite{hahn2017a}, at $z \approx 1$, the SMF interpolated between the 
\cite{li2009} and \cite{marchesini2009} SMFs is consistent with more recent 
measurements from \cite{muzzin2013} and \cite{ilbert2013}. 
\todo{TBD: Perhaps mention in appendix how we test different SMF assumptions}% (In Section~\ref{app:z1},)

Throughout its $45$ snapshot outs, $\mathtt{TreePM}$ simulation tracks 
the evolution of subhalos back to $z \sim 10$. We restrict ourselves to $15$ 
snapshots from $z = 1.08$ to $z=0.05$, where we have the most statistically 
meaningful observations. Furthermore, since we're interested in centrals we only 
keep subhalos that are classified as centrals throughout the redshift 
range. This criterion removes ``black splash'' or ``ejected'' satellite 
galaxies~\citep[\emph{e.g.}][]{mamon2004,wetzel2014} misclassified as 
centrals. Finally, we have a model based on the $\mathtt{TreePM}$ $N$-body 
simulation that tracks the evolution of central subhalos from $z = 1.08$ to 
$z=0.05$. Next, we describe how we select and initialize the star forming 
central galaxies from the central subhalos in our model.

\subsection{Selecting Star Forming Centrals}  \label{sec:sfcen}
In our model, we're interested in tracking the SFR and stellar mass 
evolution of SF central galaxies. To construct such a model, we 
first need to select SF galaxies from the central galaxies in our 
simulation, described above. Since we want our model to reproduce 
observations, our selection is based on $f^\mathrm{cen}_\mathrm{SFS}(M_*)$, 
the fraction of central galaxies within the star forming sequence, 
measured from the SDSS DR7 VAGC (Section~\ref{sec:sdss}). Below, we 
describe how we derive this $f^\mathrm{cen}_\mathrm{SFS}(M_*)$ and use 
it to select SF central galaxies in our model. Afterwards we describe how 
we initalize the SFRs and $M_*$ of these galaxies in our model.

Often in the literature, an empirical color-color or SFR--$M_*$ cut 
that separates the two main modes (red/blue or star-forming/quiescent) 
in the distribution is chosen to classify 
galaxies~\citep[\emph{e.g.}][]{baldry2006, blanton2009, drory2009, peng2010, moustakas2013, hahn2015}.
The red/quiescent or blue/star-forming fractions derived from this sort 
of classification, by construction, depend on the choice of cut and 
neglect galaxy subpopulations such as transitioning galaxies~\emph{i.e.} 
galaxies in the ``green valley''. Instead, for our 
$f^\mathrm{cen}_\mathrm{SFS}(M_*)$, we use the SFS fitting method 
from \hahngmm. \hahngmm uses Gaussian Mixture Models and the Bayesian 
Information Criteria in order to fit the SFR--$M_*$ relation of a galaxy 
population and identify its SFS. This data-driven approach relaxes 
many of the assumptions and hard cuts that go into other methods. 
Furthermore, as they demonstrate in \hahngmm by applying to multiple 
simulations, it can be flexibly applied to a wide range of star 
formation and $M_*$. The weight of the SFS GMM component from the 
fitting provides an estimate of $f^\mathrm{cen}_\mathrm{SFS}$. 
In the right panel of Figure~\ref{fig:groupcat}, we plot the SFS 
GMM component (blue shaded region) of the $p(\log \mathrm{SSFR})$ 
for the SDSS DR7 central galaxies within $10.6 < \log M_* < 10.8$. 
The SFS constitutes $f^\mathrm{cen}_\mathrm{SFS} = 0.21$ of the 
SDSS central galaxies in this stellar mass bin. 

%we instead use a method from \todo{Hahn et al.~(in prep)} and Tjitske et 
%al.~(in prep), which is a data-driven fitting of the SFS from the SFR-$M_*$ 
%distribution using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs). 
%Using the Hahn et al.~(in prep) SFS fitting, we fit the SSFR 
%distributions of the SDSS DR7 VAGC centrals in $\log\,M_*$ bins 
%of width $0.2~\mathrm{dex}$ using GMMs with $k = 1 - 3$ components 
%using the expectation-maximization 
%algorithm~\citep[EM;][]{dempster1977, neal1998}. We restrict 
%ourselves to models with a maximum of $3$ components for the three 
%possible galaxy classifications: quiescent, SF, and transitioning populations. From the three GMMs, we select the model with 
%the lowest Bayesian Information Criteria~\citep[BIC;][]{schwarz1978}. 
%The Gaussian component of this GMM with mean $\log \mathrm{SSFR} > -11$ 
%is identified as the SFS. In the rare cases when more than one GMM 
%component has mean $\log \mathrm{SSFR} > -11$, we compare the weights 
%of the components.  If the weight of one component is less than a 
%third of the other, we take the component with the higher weight to 
%represent the SFS. Otherwise, we omit the stellar mass bin altogether. 
%\todo{sentence about how for the VAGC, we don't omit any stellar mass bins} 

Rather than using the $f^\mathrm{cen}_\mathrm{SFS}$ values directly, 
for selecting SF galaxies, we fit $f^\mathrm{cen}_\mathrm{SFS}$ as 
a linear function of $\log\,M_*$ similar to \cite{wetzel2013,hahn2017}. 
We derive the following best-fit: 
\beq \label{eq:f_cen_sfms}
f^\mathrm{cen}_\mathrm{SFS, bestfit}(M_*) = -0.627\,(\log\,M_* - 10.5) + 0.354. 
\eeq
We note that this $f^\mathrm{cen}_\mathrm{SFS, bestfit}(M_*)$ is in good 
agreement with the $f_\mathrm{Q}^\mathrm{cen}(M_*; z\sim0)$ fit from 
\cite{hahn2017a}. For each central galaxy in our simulation, we assign 
a probability of it being on the SFS, using Eq.~\ref{eq:f_cen_sfms} 
with $M_*$ at $z \sim 0$ assigned through SHAM. Based on these 
probablities, we randomly identify centrals from our simulation as SF at 
$z \sim 0$. In our model, we make the assumption that once a SF galaxy 
quenches its star formation, it remains quiescent.  %\todo{maybe something about rejuvenation?} 
Without any quiescent galaxies rejuvenating their star formation, galaxies
on the SFS at $z\sim0$ are also on the SFS at $z > 0$. Using this assumption
the SF centrals we select at $z \sim 0$ are also on the SFS at the intial
redshift of our model: $z \sim 1$. 

Next, we can initialize the SF centrals at $z\sim1$ using SHAM $M_*$s and 
assign their initial SFRs based on the observed SFR-$M_*$ relation of the SFS. 
Observations in the literature at these redshifts, however, not only use 
galaxy properties derived differently from the SDSS VAGC but they also 
find SFS with significant discrepancies from one another. \cite{speagle2014} 
compiles the SFR-$M_*$ relation of the SFS from 25 studies in the literature, 
each with different methods of deriving galaxy properties. Even \emph{after} 
their calibration, for a fixed $M_* = 10^{10.5}\, M_\odot$, the SFRs of the 
SFSs at $z \sim 1$ vary by more than a factor of 2~\citep[see Figure 2 of][]{speagle2014}. 
With little consensus on the SFS at $z\sim1$, and consequently its redshift
evolution, we flexibly parameterize the SFS SFR ($\log\,\mathrm{SFR}_\mathrm{MS}(M_*, z)$) 
with free parameters $m_{M_*}$ and $m_z$ that characterize the stellar mass 
and redshift dependences respectively.  %and marginalize over them later in the analysis. 
%This is particularly concerning since the redshift evolution of the SFS dictate the SFR and $M_*$ evolution of SF centrals in our model. 
%So to deal with this uncertainty, we parameterize 
%For our $\log\,\mathrm{SFR}_\mathrm{MS}(M_*, z)$, at $z \sim 0$ we anchor our 
%SFS to the SFS of the SDSS central galaxies, which we obtain from the 
%SFS GMM components used to estimate $f^\mathrm{cen}_\mathrm{SFS}$. Using 
%the mean $\log\, \mathrm{SFR}$ of the SFS GMM component at each stellar 
%mass bin, we linearly fit $\log\, \mathrm{SFR}(M_*)$ (see dashed line in 
%Figure~\ref{fig:groupcat}). Then for $z > 0$, we include two free 
%parameters to account for the redshift evolution of the amplitude and 
%slope of the SFS SFR-$M_*$ relation: $A_z$ and $m_z$, respectively. 
We parameterize the mean $\log\,\mathrm{SFR}$ of the SFS as, 
\beq \label{eq:logsfr_ms}
\log\,\overline{\mathrm{SFR}}_\mathrm{SFS}(M_*, z) =  m_{M_*} * (\log\,M_* - 10.5) + m_z * (z - 0.05) - 0.11.
\eeq
We assign SFRs to our SF centrals at $z\sim1$ by sampling a log-normal 
distribution centered about $\log\,\overline{\mathrm{SFR}}_\mathrm{MS}(M_*, z=1)$ 
with a constant scatter of $0.3\,\mathrm{dex}$, motivated from 
observations~\citep{daddi2007, noeske2007, magdis2012, whitaker2012}.
Later in our analysis, for the priors of our parameters $m_{M_*}$ 
and $m_z$, we conservatively choose a range that encompass the best-fit 
SFS from~\cite{speagle2014} and measurements from~\cite{moustakas2013} 
and~\cite{lee2015}. With our SF centrals initalized at $z \sim 1$, next, 
we describe how we evolve their SFR and $M_*$.

\subsection{Evolving along the Star Formation Sequence} \label{sec:modelevol} 
The tight correlation between the SFRs and stellar masses of SF 
galaxies (the so-called SFS) has been observed to span over four 
orders of magnitude in stellar mass and extends beyond the local 
universe out to $z > 2$ 
(\emph{e.g.}~\citealt{noeske2007,daddi2007,elbaz2007,salim2007,santini2009,karim2011,whitaker2012,moustakas2013,lee2015}; see also references in \citealt{speagle2014}). 
Even in hydrodynamic simulations and semi-analytic models, we find 
well defined SFSs (see \hahngmm and references therein). The SFRs 
of galaxies on the SFS, for a given stellar mass follow a log-normal 
distribution with a roughly constant scatter ($\sim0.3\,\mathrm{dex}$ 
in observations).  %In bins of $\mathrm{log}\,M_*$, the SFRs of galaxies on the SFS are observed to follow a log-normal distribution with a roughly constant scatter of $0.3\,\mathrm{dex}$. 
Given its persistence in the local Universe, the SFS provides a 
anchoring relationship to characterize the SFRs and $M_*$s of SF 
galaxies throughout $z < 1$. More specifically, \emph{we can characterize 
the star formation histories (SFHs) of our SF centrals with respect 
to the mean $\logsfr$ of the SFS} (Eq.~\ref{eq:logsfr_ms}):
\beq \label{eq:logsfr_sf} 
\logsfr(M_*, t) = \log\,\overline{\mathrm{SFR}}_\mathrm{MS}(M_*, t) + \Delta \logsfr(t).
\eeq
Since SFHs determine the $M_*$ growth of galaxies, $\Delta \logsfr$s
in our model dictate the SFHs and $M_*$ evolution of SF centrals. 
Below, we describe the prescription for our fiducial $\Delta \logsfr(t)$.

One naive example for $\Delta \logsfr(t)$ would be to keep 
$\Delta \logsfr$ fixed from the initial offsets from the $\musfms$
in the initial SFRs of our SF central galaxies at $z\sim1$.
%In the previous section, we selected the initial SFRs of our SF centrals by sampling the log-normal distribution about the mean SFS at $z \sim 1$.  One simple prescription for $\Delta \logsfr(t)$, would be to fix $\Delta \logsfr$ based on the initial offsets from the $\musfms$.
SF centrals with higher than average initial SFRs continue evolving 
above the average SFS, while SF centrals with lower than average 
initial SFRs continue evolving below the average SFS. In addition to 
the fact that such a SFH cannot reproduce observations, which we later 
demonstrate, we do not find such a SFH in SF galaxies of hydrodynamic 
simulations such as Illustris~\cite{vogelsberger2014,genel2014}. 
%the observed scatter in the stellar mass of SF centrals at fixed halo mass. % With such SFHs, as we demonstrate later in detail, the scatter in stellar mass of the SF centrals at fixed halo mass diverges substantially with cosmic time. 
%Furthermore, in hydrodynamic simulations such as Illustris~\cite{vogelsberger2014,genel2014}, we find that $\Delta \logsfr(t)$ of SF galaxies do not remain constant.
In Figure~\ref{fig:illsfh}, we plot $\Delta \logsfr$s of SF galaxies 
in Illustris as a function of cosmic time. These galaxies have stellar 
masses within $10^{10.5}-10^{10.6}M_\odot$ at $z=0$. At each simultation 
output, we derive $\musfms$ using the same \hahngmm fitting method as in
Section~\ref{sec:sfcen} and use it to calculate $\Delta \logsfr$ 
(Eq.~\ref{eq:logsfr_sf}). As the $\Delta \logsfr$s highlighted in color 
illustrate, the $\Delta \logsfr(t)$s of SF galaxies do not remain constant, 
but rather vary about the SFS. 
%Rather than remaining constant, Figure~\ref{fig:illsfh} illustrates that the $\Delta \logsfr(t)$s stochastically vary about SFS. 

Motivated by the $\Delta \logsfr(t)$ of Illustris galaxies, we introduce 
variability in the SFHs of our SF centrals in the form of a ``\emph{star 
formation duty cycle}''. We parameterize $\Delta \logsfr$ to flucutate about 
the mean SFS on some duty cycle timescale $t_\mathrm{duty}$ with amplitude
randomly sampled from a log-normal distribution with $0.3\,\mathrm{dex}$ 
scatter at every $t_\mathrm{duty}$ timestep. The full SFH of the SF 
centrals follow Eq.~\ref{eq:logsfr_sf}.
%Then the SFR of a given SF central in our model will follow Eq.~\ref{eq:logsfr_sf} where at every timestep $t_\mathrm{duty}$, $\Delta \logsfr$ is randomly sampled from a log-normal distribution with $0.3\,\mathrm{dex}$ scatter. 
In the left panel of Figure~\ref{fig:sfh_model}, we 
present $\Delta \logsfr(t)$ of SF centrals with our fiducial star formation 
duty cycle prescription. The two $\Delta \logsfr(t)$s have $t_\mathrm{duty}=1$ 
Gyr (blue) and $5$ Gyr (orange). The shaded region represents the observed 
$0.3\,\mathrm{dex}$ $1\sigma$ scatter of the SFS SFR. 
Although, we do not expect such a simplified model to reflect the exact 
individual SFHs of SF centrals, for the SF population it captures the 
stochasticity from gas accretion, star-bursts, and feedback mechanisms.
Furthermore, it allows us to measure the timescale of such variabilities. 
Also this $\Delta \logsfr$ prescription by construction reproduces the 
observed log-normal SFR distribution of the SFS at any point in the model. 

Next using our $\Delta \logsfr$ prescription, we now evolve both the 
SFR and $M_*$ of our SF centrals along the SFS. Based on Eq.~\ref{eq:logsfr_sf},
the SFRs of our SF centrals are functions of $M_*$. Meanwhile, $M_*$ 
is the integral of the SFR over time: 
\beq \label{eq:integ_mass} 
M_*(t) = f_\mathrm{retain} \int\limits_{t_0}^{t} \mathrm{SFR(M_*, t)}\,\mathrm{d}t + M_0. 
\eeq
$t_0$ and $M_0$ are the initial cosmic time and stellar mass at $z \sim 1$, 
respectively. $f_\mathrm{retain}$ here is the fraction of stellar mass 
that is retained after supernovae and stellar winds; we use $f_\mathrm{retain} = 0.6$~\citep{wetzel2013}. 
By solving the differential equation from combining Eqs.~\ref{eq:logsfr_sf} 
and~\ref{eq:integ_mass}, we evolve the SFR and $M_*$ of our SF centrals.  
The right panel of Figure~\ref{fig:sfh_model} presents the $\mathrm{SFR}_i$ 
and $M_{*,i}$ evolutions for the two SF centrals with different 
$t_\mathrm{duty}$ timescales in the left panel. For reference, we include 
$\musfms(M_{*,i}(t), t)$ (black dashed) and $\musfms(M_*)$ 
(dotted lines) at various redshifts between $z = 1$ to $0.05$. As 
Figure~\ref{fig:sfh_model} illustrates, using our $\Delta \logsfr$ 
prescription the SF centrals evolve as their SFRs fluctuate along the SFS 
throughout the timesteps of our model. 

We continue to evolve our SF central galaxies until the final $z = 0.05$ 
snapshot. For the SF centrals in our model, not only do we have SFRs and 
$M_*$s that we evolved but we also have their host halo properties from the 
$\mathtt{TreePM}$ $N$-body simulation. Using these properties, we can compare 
our model to observations and constrain the free parameters using observables 
such as the quiescent fraction and SMF. Once we have a model that reproduces 
the standard observables we can use the host halo properties to examine 
observables such as the SHMR. Next, we present this comparison between 
our model and observations and present the constraints we derive on the role 
and timescale of star formation variability in the evolution of SF galaxies.

\section{Results}
Our model takes $\mathtt{TreePM}$ central subhalos and tracks their $SFR$ 
and $M_*$ evolution using a flexible parameterization of the SFS and 
SFHs that incorporate variability through a star formation duty cycle.
At $z = 0.05$, its final timestep, our model provides properties such 
as the SFR, $M_*$, and host halo mass, $M_h$, of central galaxies it 
classifies as SF. We now use these resulting properties to compare our 
model to observations and constrain its free parameters---the parameters 
of the Eq.~\ref{eq:logsfr_ms} SFS. Since the focus of our model and this 
paper is on SF centrals, the main observable we use is the SMF of star 
forming centrals in SDSS, which we estimate as 
\beq \label{eq:smf_sf_cen} 
\Phi^\mathrm{SDSS}_\mathrm{SF,cen} = f^\mathrm{cen}_\mathrm{SFS} \times f_\mathrm{cen} \times \Phi^\mathrm{Li\&White(2009)}.
\eeq
$f^\mathrm{cen}_\mathrm{SFS}$ is the fraction of central galaxies on the 
SFS, which we fit in Eq.~\ref{eq:f_cen_sfms}. $f_\mathrm{cen}$ is the 
central galaxy fraction from \cite{wetzel2013} and $\Phi^\mathrm{Li\&White(2009)}$ 
is the SMF of the SDSS from \cite{li2009}. If our model reproduces the 
observed $\Phi^\mathrm{SDSS}_\mathrm{SF,cen}$, by construction, it also 
reproduces the observed quiescent fraction. 

For the actual comparison of our model to observation, we use the parameter 
estimation framework of Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC). ABC has the 
advantage over standard approaches to parameter inference in that it does not 
require evaluating the likelihood. It relies only on a simulation of the observed 
data and a distance metric to quantify the ``closeness'' between the observed data
and simulation. Many variations of ABC has been used in astronomy and 
cosmology~\citep[\emph{e.g.}][]{cameron2012,weyant2013,ishida2015,alsing2018}. 
We use ABC in conjunction with the efficient Population Monte Carlo (PMC)
importance sampling as in~\citep{hahn2016, hahn2017}. For initial range of our
ABC particles, \emph{i.e.} the priors of our Eq.~\ref{eq:logsfr_ms} SFS parameters
\todo{$A_z$ and $m_z$}, we use uniform distributions spanning the ranges 
\todo{numbers} and \todo{numbers}, respectively. As we mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:sfcen}, 
the range of the prior were conservatively chosen to encompass the best-fit SFS from~\cite{speagle2014} 
and measurements from~\cite{moustakas2013} and~\cite{lee2015} at $z \sim 1$. 
Finally, for our distance metric, we formulate a distance between the SMF of
the SF centrals in our model to the observed $\Phi^\mathrm{SDSS}_\mathrm{SF,cen}$ 
(Eq.~\ref{eq:smf_sf_cen}): 
\beq
\rho_\Phi = \sum\limits_{M} \left( \frac{\Phi^\mathrm{sim} - \Phi^\mathrm{SDSS}_\mathrm{SF,cen}}{\sigma'_\Phi}\right)^2.
\eeq
$\Phi^\mathrm{sim}(M)$ is the SMF of the SF centrals in our model and 
\todo{$\sigma'_\Phi(M)$ is the SMF uncertainty derived using mock catalogs from~\cite{li2009}}. 
For the rest of our ABC-PMC implementation, we strictly follow the implementation 
of \cite{hahn2017b} and~\cite{hahn2017a}. We refer reader to those papers for 
further details.

%on the right, 
%we demonstrate that different prescriptions for SFHs in our model produce significantly
%different scatter in $\log\,M_*$ for a given $\log\,M_\mathrm{halo}$ --- 
%\emph{i.e.} scatter in the SMHMR. 
%Since there are observation constraints on 
%the SMHMR, this means that we can them to better understand and constrain 
%the SFHs of star forming galaxies.

\subsection{The Star Formation Duty Cycle} \label{sec:sfdutycycle}
In Figure~\ref{fig:abc_demo}, we present the SMFs (left), SFSs (middle), and 
$\sigma_{\log\,M_*}(\mathrm{log}\,M_\mathrm{halo})$ (right) of two models 
with different SFH prescriptions each run using the medians parameter values 
of their ABC posterior distributions --- $\theta_\mathrm{median}$. One model 
has duty cycle of $t_\mathrm{duty} = 10\,\mathrm{Gyr}$ (red) while the other 
has a duty cycle of $t_\mathrm{duty} = 1\,\mathrm{Gyr}$ (blue). Both models, 
as expected from the ABC posteriors, successfully reproduce the SDSS SMF 
($\Phi^\mathrm{SDSS}_\mathrm{SF,cen}$). By construction, \emph{i.e.} the priors, 
they also have SFSs consistent with observations. Despite their consistency, 
however, \emph{the difference in the star formation duty cycle timescales of 
the models results in dramatically different scatter in $\log\,M_*$ at a given 
$\log\,M_\mathrm{halo}$ (\emph{i.e.} scatter in the SHMR)}, particularly below 
$M_\mathrm{halo} < 10^{12.5}M_\odot$. 

Since the scatter in SHMR of our model depends on the star formation duty cycle
timescale, we can compare the scatter from our model to observational constraints
on the SHMR in order to constrain the star formation duty cycle and the SFHs of star 
forming galaxies (Figure~\ref{fig:sigMstar_duty}). More specifically, in 
Figure~\ref{fig:sigMstar_duty}, we present $\sigma_{\log\,M_*}$, the scatter in 
$\log\,M_*$ at fixed halo mass, at $M_h = 10^{12} M_\odot$) and $\sigma_{\log\,M_h}$, 
the scatter in $\log\,M_h$ at fixed stellar mass, at $M_* = 10^{10} M_\odot$  
as a function of $t_\mathrm{duty}$ (left and right panels). For $t_\mathrm{duty}$ 
ranging from $10$ to $0.5\,\mathrm{Gyr}$, $\sigma_{\log\,M_*}$ ranges from 
\todo{$0.32\substack{+5.1\\ -4.0}$ to $0.26\substack{+5.1\\ -4.0}\,\mathrm{dex}$ 
and $\sigma_{\log\,M_h}$ ranges from number to number}. With a shorter star formation 
duty timescale, our model produces significantly smaller scatter in the SHMR. 

In order to constrain $t_\mathrm{duty}$, we compare $\sigma_{\log\,M_*}$ and 
$\sigma_{\log\,M_h}$ in our model to observational constraints from the 
literature. These constraints are mainly derived from fitting some sort of halo 
occupation based models to observations of galaxy clustering, SMF, satellite 
kinematics, or galaxy-galaxy weak lensing. On the left panel, we include 
$\sigma_{\log\,M_*}$ constraints from~\cite{yang2009, more2011, leauthaud2012, tinker2013, zu2015}. 
\cite{more2011, zu2015} fit satellite kinematics, galaxy clustering, and 
galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements of the SDSS VAGC. Meanwhile 
\cite{leauthaud2012, tinker2013} fit the SMF, galaxy clustering, and galaxy-galaxy 
lensing to COSMOS. \cite{yang2009}, unlike the other methods, use a group catalog 
constructed from SDSS DR4\todo{cite} to measure the scatter in the log-normal $M_*$ 
distribution at a given $M_h$. Although, \cite{leauthaud2012, zu2015} measure 
$\sigma_{\log\,M_*}$ for all central galaxies, at $M_h\sim 10^{12}M_\odot$ there 
is a $< 1\sigma$ difference in $\sigma_{\log\,M_*}$ between star-forming and 
quiescent central galaxies~\citep{yang2009, more2011, tinker2013}. Hence we 
include them in Figure~\ref{fig:sigMstar_duty}.

$\sigma_{\log\,M_h}$ from the uncertainties in these $M_h$ measurements at $M_*$ bin 
$\sim 10^{10}M_\odot$. From \cite{mandelbaum2006a, more2011, velander2014} we have 
$\sigma_{\log\,M_h}$ for blue/late-type/star forming centrals while we have

%We find that by decreasing the timescale of stochasticity on a simple SFH model that traces the overall 
%SFS evolution does in fact decrease the scatter seen in the SMHMR. 
The $\sigma_{\log\,M_h}$ constraints from the literature are significantly scatter 
from $0.12$ to $0.6\,\mathrm{dex}$ (right). $\sigma_{\log\,M_h}$ from our model, 
regardless of $t_\mathrm{duty}$ is well within this range, so the comparison does 
not provide much constraint on $t_\mathrm{duty}$. Furthermore the $\sigma_{\log\,M_h}$
are not directly constrained but derived from measurements of $M_h$. On the other
hand, the constraints for $\sigma_{\log\,M_h}$ in the literature are relatively 
consistent: $\sigma_{\log\,M_*} \lesssim 0.2$. Some of these constraints are from 
analyses that use halo models that fix $\sigma_{\log\,M_*}$ as a function of 
$M_h$~\citep{leauthaud2012, tinker2013, zu2015}. Such analyses may not serve 
as ideal measurements of $\sigma_{\log\,M_*}$ at a specific $M_h\sim 10^{12}M_\odot$.
Excluding those analyses, bring $\sigma_{\log\,M_*}$ lower. Based on the $\sigma_{\log\,M_*}$ 
comparison, our models with longer duty cycles timescales produce scatters too 
large to reconcile with observations. A short duty cycle timescale, $t_\mathrm{duty} < 1\,\mathrm{Gyr}$ 
is necessary for our model to be roughly consistent with constraints in the 
literature. However, \emph{even for the shortest duty cycle timescale we probe 
($\sigma_{\log\,M_*} = $\todo{number} for $t_\mathrm{duty} = 0.5\,\mathrm{Gyr}$), 
we find some tension in $\sigma_{\log\,M_*}$ between our model and constraints 
in the literature.}

\subsection{The Need for Assembly Bias?}
A shorter star formation duty cycle timescale produces smaller scatter in the 
SHMR of our model. This means that we can use measurements of $\sigma_{\log\,M_*}$ 
and $\sigma_{\log\,M_h}$ to constrain $t_\mathrm{duty}$, which reflect the 
star formation variability timescale. Comparisons to the literature, in the 
previous section, demonstrate that $t_\mathrm{duty} < 1\,\mathrm{Gyr}$ is 
necessary but not enough to conservatively reproduce observed $\sigma_{\log\,M_*}$ 
constraints. In an effort to better reproduce observed SHMR scatter constraints, 
in this section, we introduce \emph{assembly bias} into the SFH prescription of 
our model.

Assembly bias, most commonly in the literature, refers to the dependence of the 
spatial distribution of dark matter halos on halo properties besides 
mass~\citep{gao2005,wechsler2006,gao2007,wetzel2007,li2008,sunayama2016}.
At low halo mass, older and more concentrated halos form in high density environments. 
While at high halo mass, the effect is the opposite: younger, less concentrated 
halos form in high-density regions. Furthermore, as predicted by semi-analytic 
models~\citep{croton2007} and found using galaxy group 
catalogs~\citep{yang2006,wang2008,tinker2011,wang2013,lacerna2014,tinker2017,tinker2017b,tinker2018},
this assembly bias propagates beyond spatial clustering to galaxy properties
such as formation histories and star formation properties. 

For our model, we incorporate assembly bias by correlating the SFHs of our SF 
central galaxies with halo growth histories. More specifically, we correlate the 
galaxy SFR with respect to the mean SFS SFR (\emph{i.e.} $\Delta\log\,\mathrm{SFR}$ 
in Eq.~\ref{eq:logsfr_sf}) to the halo mass accretion over dynamical time. At every 
$t_\mathrm{duty}$ timestep, $t$, $\Delta\log\,\mathrm{SFR}(t)$ is assigned based
on $\Delta M_h(t) = M_h(t) - M_h(t - t_\mathrm{dyn}(t))$ in $M_\mathrm{max}$ bins 
with a correlation coefficient $r$, a parameter added to our model. Our prescription 
for track halo mass accretion over dynamical time is similar to 
the~\cite{rodriguez-puebla2016,behroozi2018a} empirical models. In 
Figure~\ref{fig:mhacc_dsfr} we illustrate how we incorporate assembly bias into 
the SF centrals of our model and the correlation between the host halo accretion 
history with the SFH with respect to the SFS SFR. We plot the relative halo
accretion histories $M_h(t)/M_h(z{=}0.05)$ of two arbitrarily chosen SF centrals 
with $M_h(z{=}0.05)\sim10^{12}M_\odot$ in the top panel. Below, we plot 
$\Delta\log\,\mathrm{SFR}$, SFH with respect to the SFS, of these galaxies 
for our model with correlation coefficients $r=0.5$ and $0.99$ (middle and bottom). 
At some $t$, we choose a random $\mathtt{TreePM}$ snapshot (dotted), 
$\Delta\log\,\mathrm{SFR}(t)$ is correlated with halo accretion over the period 
$t - t_\mathrm{dyn}$ to $t$ (shaded top panel). The SFHs illustrate 
how $\Delta\log\,\mathrm{SFR}(t)$ correlates with $\Delta M_h = M_h(t) - M_h(t-t_\mathrm{dyn})$. 
Furthermore, as $r$ ranges from $0$ to $1$, $\Delta\log\,\mathrm{SFR}(t)$ correlates 
more with halo accretion history, $\Delta M_h(t)$ (Figure~\ref{fig:mhacc_dsfr}). 
%As an example, we mark $t$ corresponding to one of the $\mathtt{TreePM}$ snapshots in the panels (dotted) and the $t_\mathrm{dyn}$ period beforehand that we use to calculate halo accretion in the top panel (shaded). We also shade the ${\sim}1\sigma$ (${\sim}\,0.3\,\mathrm{dex}$) of the SFS SFR in the SFH panels. 

We again compare our model with different values of $r$ to observations using 
ABC (see Section~\ref{sec:sfdutycycle}). Using the resulting posterior estimates, 
we examine the scatter in the SHMR ($\sigma_{\log\,M_*}$) of our models %, which reproduce the observed SMF of SF centrals and SFS,
with $r=0$ (no assembly bias; blue), $0.5$ (orange), and $0.99$ (green) as a 
function of $t_\mathrm{duty}$ in Figure~\ref{fig:sigMstar_duty_abias}. At 
$t_\mathrm{duty} \geq 5\,\mathrm{Gyr}$ we find little difference in $\sigma_{\log\,M_*}$.
Below $t_\mathrm{duty} < 5\,\mathrm{Gyr}$, however, \emph{$\sigma_{\log\,M_*}$ in 
our model decreases significantly with stronger assembly bias in our model.} 
For $t_\mathrm{duty} = 0.5\,\mathrm{Gyr}$, we find $\sigma_{\log\,M_*} = $
\todo{final numbers} for $r = 0., 0.5$, and $0.99$, respectively. 

Comparing to the constraints from Figure~\ref{fig:sigMstar_duty}, we find that 
incorporating assembly bias significantly reduces the tensions with observations 
(right panel). In fact, with a short star formation duty cycle 
($t_\mathrm{duty} \leq 1\,\mathrm{Gyr}$) and strong assembly bias, our model
can conservatively reproduce most of the $\sigma_{\log\,M_*}$ constraints from
the literature. There is, however, still some tension with the \cite{yang2009} 
constraint. We note that \todo{the yang2009 results should be taken with a grain of salt. 
Here's why: }
\bitem
    \item Yang's satellite fraction for the sample split by color is significantly 
        lower. This means that a significant fraction of satellite galaxies considered
        centrals. 
    \item red fraction is off for centrals at $M_h\sim10^{12}M_\odot$. 
\eitem

In addition to the comparison with observational constraints, we also compare the 
SHMR scatters of our models to $\sigma_{\log\,M_*}$ from modern galaxy formation 
models: hydrodynamic simulations (dot filled), semi-analytic models (hatched), and 
an empirial model (dashed line). For the hydrodynamic simulations, the dotted region 
encompasses the constraints from EAGLE\todo{cite}, Massive Black II\todo{cite}, and 
Illustris TNG\todo{cite}, as in Figure 8 of \cite{wechsler2018}. For the semi-analytic 
models, the hatched region includes Lu et al. (2014), Somerville et al. (2012), and 
the SAGE model\footnote{\href{https://tao.asvo.org.au/tao/}}. Finally for the empirical 
model, we include the Universe Machine from \cite{behroozi2018a}.
\todo{There's not much to this figure besides the same conclusion as \cite{wechsler2018}. 
Hydros are consistent with literature; SAMs and empirical models don't do so great. 
In fact, our model with a short duty cycle alone (even without assembly bias) produces 
smaller $\sigma_{\log\,M_*}$. 
}

Lots of papers coming out recently talking about how the SFS is just CLT or 
that SFH can just be log-normal distributions. But none of those works connect
galaxies to halos. Using the SFHs from Louis, we try this out and see if we 
can reproduce the small SHMR scatter. We don't.

\section{$z \sim 1$ Initial Conditions} \label{app:z1}
Much of the results presented in this paper are based on comparison 
between our model and observations at $z \sim 0.$. Our model is initalized 
at $z \sim 1$. Therefore, in this section we test some of the choices 
we make in our intializations. 

\bitem
\item Test impact of $z \sim 1$ SMF
\item Test impact of $z \sim 1$ $\sigma_{\log M_*}$
