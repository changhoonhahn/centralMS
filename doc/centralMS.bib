  abstract = {Methods that exploit galaxy clustering to constrain the galaxy-halo 
relationship, such as the halo occupation distribution (HOD) and
conditional luminosity function (CLF), assume halo mass alone suffices
to determine a halo's galaxy content. Yet, halo clustering strength
depends upon properties other than mass, such as formation time, an
effect known as assembly bias. If galaxy characteristics are correlated
with these auxiliary halo properties, the basic assumption of standard
HOD/CLF methods is violated. We estimate the potential for assembly bias
to induce systematic errors in inferred halo occupation statistics. We
construct realistic mock galaxy catalogues that exhibit assembly bias as
well as companion mock catalogues with identical HODs, but with assembly
bias removed. We fit HODs to the galaxy clustering in each catalogue. In
the absence of assembly bias, the inferred HODs describe the true HODs
well, validating the methodology. However, in all cases with assembly
bias, the inferred HODs exhibit significant systematic errors. We
conclude that the galaxy-halo relationship inferred from galaxy
clustering is subject to significant systematic errors induced by
assembly bias. Efforts to model and/or constrain assembly bias should be
priorities as assembly bias is a threatening source of systematic error
in galaxy evolution and precision cosmology studies.},

  abstract = {We have constructed an extended halo model (EHM) which relates the total 
stellar mass and star-formation rate (SFR) to halo mass (Mh).
An empirical relation between the distribution functions of total
stellar mass of galaxies and host halo mass, tuned to match the spatial
density of galaxies over 0 $<$ z $<$ 2 and the clustering properties
at z \texttildelow{} 0, is extended to include two different scenarios
describing the variation of SFR on Mh. We also present new
measurements of the redshift evolution of the average SFR for
star-forming galaxies of different stellar masses up to z = 2, using
data from the Herschel Multi-tiered Extragalactic Survey for infrared
bright galaxies.

Combining the EHM with the halo accretion histories from numerical
simulations, we trace the stellar mass growth and star-formation history
in haloes spanning a range of masses. We find that: (1) the intensity of
the star-forming activity in haloes in the probed mass range has
steadily decreased from z \texttildelow{} 2 to 0; (2) at a given epoch, haloes
in the mass range between a few times 1011 M$\odot$
and a few times 1012 M$\odot$ are the most efficient
at hosting star formation; (3) the peak of SFR density shifts to lower
mass haloes over time; and (4) galaxies that are forming stars most
actively at z \texttildelow{} 2 evolve into quiescent galaxies in today's group
environments, strongly supporting previous claims that the most powerful
starbursts at z \texttildelow{} 2 are progenitors of today's elliptical
galaxies.},

easily understood if galaxies below this stellar mass scale continue to
form stars while star formation in galaxies above this scale is quenched
and the dark matter halos of galaxies both above and below this scale
grow in accordance with $\Lambda$CDM cosmological simulations. Host
galaxies that are red in U-B color have larger satellite dispersions and

  abstract = {We present the results of a study of weak gravitational lensing by 
galaxies using imaging data that were obtained as part of the second Red
Sequence Cluster Survey (RCS2). In order to compare to the baryonic
properties of the lenses we focus here on the \textasciitilde{}300 square degrees that
overlap with the data release 7 (DR7) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS). The depth and image quality of the RCS2 enables us to
significantly improve upon earlier work for luminous galaxies at z $\geq$
0.3. To model the lensing signal we employ a halo model which accounts
for the clustering of the lenses and distinguishes between satellite and
central galaxies. Comparison with dynamical masses from the SDSS shows a
good correlation with the lensing mass for early-type galaxies. The
correlation is less clear for late-type galaxies, possibly due to
rotation. For low luminosity (stellar mass) early-type galaxies we find
a satellite fraction of \textasciitilde{}40\% which rapidly decreases to $<$10\% with
increasing luminosity (stellar mass). The satellite fraction of the
late-types has a value in the range 0-15\%, independent of luminosity or
stellar mass. At high masses the satellite fraction is not well
constrained, which we partly attribute to the modelling assumptions. To
infer virial masses we apply simple models based on an independent
satellite kinematics analysis to account for intrinsic scatter in the
scaling relations. We find that early-types in the range 1010
$<$ Lr $<$ 1011.5 L$\odot$ have virial
masses that are about five times higher than those of late-type galaxies
and that the mass scales as M200 $\propto$
L2.34-0.16+0.09. For an early-type
galaxy with a fiducal luminosity of 1011 Lr, $\odot$
, we obtain a mass M200 =
(1.93-0.14+0.13)\texttimes{}1013
h-1 M$\odot$. We also measure the virial
mass-to-light ratio, and find for L200 $<$ 1011
L$\odot$ a value of M200/L200 = 42
$\pm$ 10 for early-types, which increases for higher luminosities to
values that are consistent with those observed for groups and clusters
of galaxies. For late-type galaxies we find a lower value of
M200/L200 = 17 $\pm$ 9. Our measurements also
show that early- and late-type galaxies have comparable halo masses for
stellar masses M${_\ast}$ $<$ 1011
M$\odot$, whereas the virial masses of early-type galaxies are
higher for higher stellar masses. To compare the efficiency with which
baryons have been converted into stars, we determine the total stellar
mass within r200. Our results for early-type galaxies suggest
a variation in efficiency with a minimum of \textasciitilde{}10\% for a stellar mass
M${_\ast}$,200 = 1012 M$\odot$. The
results for the late-type galaxies are not well constrained, but do
suggest a larger value.},

  abstract = {In our modern understanding of galaxy formation, every galaxy forms within a dark matter halo. The formation and growth of galaxies over time is connected to the growth of the halos in which they form. The advent of large galaxy surveys as well as high-resolution cosmological simulations has provided a new window into the statistical relationship between galaxies and halos and its evolution. Here we define this galaxy-halo connection as the multi-variate distribution of galaxy and halo properties that can be derived from observations and simulations. This connection provides a key test of physical galaxy formation models; it also plays an essential role in constraints of cosmological models using galaxy surveys and in elucidating the properties of dark matter using galaxies. We review techniques for inferring the galaxy-halo connection and the insights that have arisen from these approaches. Some things we have learned are that galaxy formation efficiency is a strong function of halo mass; at its peak in halos around a pivot halo mass of 10\^12 Msun, less than 20\% of the available baryons have turned into stars by the present day; the intrinsic scatter in galaxy stellar mass is small, less than 0.2 dex at a given halo mass above this pivot mass; below this pivot mass galaxy stellar mass is a strong function of halo mass; the majority of stars over cosmic time were formed in a narrow region around this pivot mass. We also highlight key open questions about how galaxies and halos are connected, including understanding the correlations with secondary properties and the connection of these properties to galaxy clustering.},

deg2 COSMOS field. The average star formation rate (SFR) for subsets of these galaxies is estimated with stacked 1.4 GHz radio continuum emission. We separately consider the total sample and a subset of galaxies that shows evidence for substantive recent star formation in the rest-frame optical spectral energy distributions. At redshifts 0.2 $<$ z $<$ 3 both populations show a strong and mass-independent
decrease in their SSFR toward the present epoch. It is best described by a power law (1 + z) n , where n \textasciitilde{} 4.3 for all galaxies and n \textasciitilde{} 3.5 for star-forming (SF) sources. The decrease appears to have started at z$>$2, at least for high-mass (M * $>$\textasciitilde{} 4
\texttimes{} 1010 M sun) systems where our conclusions are most robust. Our data show that there is a tight correlation with power-law dependence, SSFR vprop M * $\beta$,
between SSFR and stellar mass at all epochs. The relation tends to flatten below M * $\approx$ 1010 M sun if quiescent galaxies are included; if they are excluded from the analysis a shallow index $\beta$SFG $\approx$ -0.4 fits the correlation. On
average, higher mass objects always have lower SSFRs, also among SF galaxies. At z$>$1.5 there is tentative evidence for an upper threshold in SSFR that an average galaxy cannot exceed, possibly due to
gravitationally limited molecular gas accretion. It is suggested by a flattening of the SSFR-M * relation (also for SF sources), but affects massive ($>$1010 M sun) galaxies only at the highest redshifts. Since z = 1.5 there thus is no direct evidence that galaxies of higher mass experience a more rapid waning of their SSFR than lower mass SF systems. In this sense, the data rule out any strong "downsizing" in the SSFR. We combine our results with recent measurements of the galaxy (stellar) mass function in order to determine the characteristic mass of an SF galaxy: we find that since z \textasciitilde{} 3 the majority of all new stars were always formed in galaxies of M
* = 1010.6$\pm$0.4 M sun. In this
sense, too, there is no "downsizing." Finally, our analysis constitutes the most extensive SFR density determination with a single technique out to z = 3. Recent Herschel results are consistent with our results, but rely on far smaller samples.},

these H I-deficient galaxies appear to lie significantly further away

  abstract = {Galaxies strongly self-regulate their growth via energetic feedback from stars, supernovae, and black holes, but these processes are among the least understood aspects of galaxy formation theory. We present an analytic galaxy evolution model that directly constrains such feedback processes from observed galaxy scaling relations. The equilibrium model, which is broadly valid for star-forming central galaxies that dominate cosmic star formation, is based on the ansatz that galaxies live in a slowly evolving equilibrium between inflows, outflows, and star
formation. Using a Bayesian Monte Carlo Markov chain approach, we constrain our model to match observed galaxy scaling relations between stellar mass and halo mass, star formation rate, and metallicity from 0 $<$ z $<$ 2. A good fit ($\chi$2 $\approx$ 1.6) is achieved with
eight free parameters. We further show that constraining our model to any two of the three data sets also produces a fit to the third that is within reasonable systematic uncertainties. The resulting best-fitting parameters that describe baryon cycling suggest galactic outflow scalings intermediate between energy and momentum-driven winds, a weak dependence of wind recycling time on mass, and a quenching mass scale that evolves modestly upwards with redshift. This model further predicts a stellar mass-star formation rate relation that is in good agreement with observations to z \texttildelow{} 6. Our results suggest that this simple analytic framework captures the basic physical processes required to model the mean evolution of stars and metals in galaxies, despite not incorporating many canonical ingredients of galaxy formation models such as merging or disc formation.},

parameter space of the ‘Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies and their
Environments' (EAGLE) simulation project. Four of the simulations follow
the evolution of a periodic cube L = 50 cMpc on a side, and each employs
a different subgrid model of the energetic feedback associated with star
formation. The relevant parameters were adjusted so that the simulations
each reproduce the observed galaxy stellar mass function at z = 0.1.
Three of the simulations fail to form disc galaxies as extended as
observed, and we show analytically that this is a consequence of
numerical radiative losses that reduce the efficiency of stellar
feedback in high-density gas. Such losses are greatly reduced in the
fourth simulation - the EAGLE reference model - by injecting more energy
in higher density gas. This model produces galaxies with the observed
size distribution, and also reproduces many galaxy scaling relations. In
the remaining nine simulations, a single parameter or process of the
reference model was varied at a time. We find that the properties of
galaxies with stellar mass $\lessequivlnt$ M$\star$ (the ‘knee' of the
galaxy stellar mass function) are largely governed by feedback
associated with star formation, while those of more massive galaxies are
also controlled by feedback from accretion on to their central black
holes. Both processes must be efficient in order to reproduce the
observed galaxy population. In general, simulations that have been
calibrated to reproduce the low-redshift galaxy stellar mass function
will still not form realistic galaxies, but the additional requirement
that galaxy sizes be acceptable leads to agreement with a large range of
observables.},

and their Environments (EAGLE) project, a suite of hydrodynamical
simulations that follow the formation of galaxies and supermassive black
holes in cosmologically representative volumes of a standard $\Lambda$
cold dark matter universe. We discuss the limitations of such
simulations in light of their finite resolution and poorly constrained
subgrid physics, and how these affect their predictive power. One major
improvement is our treatment of feedback from massive stars and active
galactic nuclei (AGN) in which thermal energy is injected into the gas
without the need to turn off cooling or decouple hydrodynamical forces,
allowing winds to develop without predetermined speed or mass loading
factors. Because the feedback efficiencies cannot be predicted from
first principles, we calibrate them to the present-day galaxy stellar
mass function and the amplitude of the galaxy-central black hole mass
relation, also taking galaxy sizes into account. The observed galaxy
stellar mass function is reproduced to $\lessequivlnt$ 0.2 dex over the full
resolved mass range, 108 $<$ M*/M$\odot$
$\lessequivlnt$ 1011, a level of agreement close to that attained by
semi-analytic models, and unprecedented for hydrodynamical simulations.
We compare our results to a representative set of low-redshift
observables not considered in the calibration, and find good agreement
with the observed galaxy specific star formation rates, passive
fractions, Tully-Fisher relation, total stellar luminosities of galaxy
clusters, and column density distributions of intergalactic C IV and O
VI. While the mass-metallicity relations for gas and stars are
consistent with observations for M* $\greaterequivlnt$ 109
M$\odot$ (M* $\greaterequivlnt$ 1010
M$\odot$ at intermediate resolution), they are insufficiently
steep at lower masses. For the reference model, the gas fractions and
temperatures are too high for clusters of galaxies, but for galaxy
groups these discrepancies can be resolved by adopting a higher heating
temperature in the subgrid prescription for AGN feedback. The EAGLE
simulation suite, which also includes physics variations and higher

stellar mass at redshifts z = 0 and 4, but at intermediate redshifts of
z $\simeq$ 1-2, the simulated SFMS has a significantly lower normalization
than reported by observations. The scatter in the relation is consistent
with the observed scatter. However, the fraction of outliers above the
SFR-stellar mass relation in Illustris is less than that observed.
Galaxies with halo masses of \texttildelow{}1012 M$\odot$
dominate the SFR density of the Universe, in agreement with the results
of abundance matching. Furthermore, more-massive galaxies tend to form
the bulk of their stars at high redshift, which indicates that
‘downsizing' occurs in Illustris. We also studied the star formation
histories of individual galaxies, including the use of a principal
component analysis decomposition. We find that for fixed stellar mass,
galaxies that form earlier have more-massive black holes at z = 0,
indicating that star formation and black hole growth are tightly linked
processes in Illustris. While many of the properties of normal
star-forming galaxies are well reproduced in the Illustris simulation,
forming a realistic population of starbursts will likely require higher
resolution and probably a more sophisticated treatment of star formation
and feedback from stars and black holes.},

simulation, Illustris-1, covers a volume of (106.5 Mpc)3, has
a dark mass resolution of 6.26 \texttimes{} 106 M$\odot$,

softened on scales of 710 pc, and the smallest hydrodynamical gas cells
have an extent of 48 pc. We follow the dynamical evolution of 2 \texttimes{}
18203 resolution elements and in addition passively evolve
18203 Monte Carlo tracer particles reaching a total particle
count of more than 18 billion. The galaxy formation model includes:
primordial and metal-line cooling with self-shielding corrections,
stellar evolution, stellar feedback, gas recycling, chemical enrichment,
supermassive black hole growth, and feedback from active galactic
nuclei. Here we describe the simulation suite, and contrast basic
predictions of our model for the present-day galaxy population with
observations of the local universe. At z = 0 our simulation volume
contains about 40 000 well-resolved galaxies covering a diverse range of
morphologies and colours including early-type, late-type and irregular
galaxies. The simulation reproduces reasonably well the cosmic star
formation rate density, the galaxy luminosity function, and baryon
conversion efficiency at z = 0. It also qualitatively captures the
impact of galaxy environment on the red fractions of galaxies. The
internal velocity structure of selected well-resolved disc galaxies
obeys the stellar and baryonic Tully-Fisher relation together with flat
circular velocity curves. In the well-resolved regime, the simulation
reproduces the observed mix of early-type and late-type galaxies. Our
model predicts a halo mass dependent impact of baryonic effects on the
halo mass function and the masses of haloes caused by feedback from
supernova and active galactic nuclei.},

This selection excludes red, dusty, star-forming galaxies with higher masses, which brings down the slope. By selecting on L IR/L UV (a proxy for dust obscuration) and the rest-frame U - V colors, we show that star-forming galaxies fall in three distinct regions of the log(SFR)-log(M sstarf) plane: (1) actively star-forming galaxies with "normal" dust obscuration and associated colors (54\% for log (M sstarf) $>$ 10 at 1 $<$ z $<$ 1.5), (2) red star-forming galaxies with low levels of dust
obscuration and low-specific SFRs (11\%), and (3) dusty, blue
star-forming galaxies with high-specific SFRs (7\%). The remaining 28\% comprises quiescent galaxies. Galaxies on the "normal" star formation sequence show strong trends of increasing dust attenuation with stellar mass and a decreasing specific SFR, with an observed scatter of 0.25 dex. The dusty, blue galaxies reside in the upper envelope of the star formation sequence with remarkably similar spectral shapes at all masses, suggesting that the same physical process is dominating the stellar light. The red, low-dust star-forming galaxies may be in the process of shutting off and migrating to the quiescent population.},

formation rate (SFR) and stellar mass (M *), and for
starbursting galaxies that fall outside that relation. Exploiting the
correlation of gas-to-dust mass with metallicity (M gas/M
dust-Z), we use our measurements to constrain the gas
content, CO-to-H2 conversion factors ($\alpha$CO),
and star formation efficiencies (SFE) of these distant galaxies. Using
large statistical samples, we confirm that $\alpha$CO and SFE
are an order of magnitude higher and lower, respectively, in MS galaxies
at high redshifts compared to the values of local galaxies with
equivalently high infrared luminosities (L IR $>$
1012 L $\odot$). For galaxies within the MS, we
show that the variations of specific star formation rates (sSFRs = SFR/M
*) are driven by varying gas fractions. For relatively
massive galaxies like those in our samples, we show that the hardness of
the radiation field, langUrang, which is proportional to the
dust-mass-weighted luminosity (L IR/M dust) and
the primary parameter defining the shape of the IR spectral energy
distribution (SED), is equivalent to SFE/Z. For MS galaxies with stellar
mass log (M */M $\odot$) $>$= 9.7 we measure this
quantity, langUrang, showing that it does not depend significantly on
either the stellar mass or the sSFR. This is explained as a simple
consequence of the existing correlations between SFR-M *, M
*-Z, and M gas-SFR. Instead, we show that
langUrang (or equally L IR/M dust) does evolve,
with MS galaxies having harder radiation fields and thus warmer
temperatures as redshift increases from z = 0 to 2, a trend that can
also be understood based on the redshift evolution of the M
*-Z and SFR-M * relations. These results motivate
the construction of a universal set of SED templates for MS galaxies
that are independent of their sSFR or M * but vary as a
function of redshift with only one parameter, langUrang.},

the SFR can be estimated consistently from the multiwavelength data

galaxies, and nearly all those with
L8$\mu$m$>$1011 Lsolar, show a mid-IR
excess that is likely due to the presence of obscured active nuclei, as
shown in a companion paper. There is a tight and roughly linear
correlation between stellar mass and SFR for 24 $\mu$m-detected galaxies.
For a given mass, the SFR at z=2 was larger by a factor of \textasciitilde{}4 and \textasciitilde{}30
relative to that in star-forming galaxies at z=1 and 0, respectively.
Typical ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) at z=2 are relatively
‘‘transparent'' to ultraviolet light, and their activity is long lived
($>$\textasciitilde{}400 Myr), unlike that in local ULIRGs and high-redshift
submillimeter-selected galaxies. ULIRGs are the common mode of star
formation in massive galaxies at z=2, and the high duty cycle suggests
that major mergers are not the dominant trigger for this activity.
Current galaxy formation models underpredict the normalization of the
mass-SFR correlation by about a factor of 4 and the space density of
ULIRGs by an order of magnitude but give better agreement for z$>$1.4

Here we review the current status of models that employ two leading techniques to simulate the physics of galaxy formation: semi-analytic models and numerical hydrodynamic simulations. We focus on a set of observational targets that describe the evolution of the global and structural properties of galaxies from roughly Cosmic High Noon (\$z$\backslash$sim 2-3\$) to the present. Although minor discrepancies remain, overall, models show remarkable convergence between different methods and make predictions that are in qualitative agreement with observations. Modelers seem to have converged on a core set of physical processes that are critical for shaping galaxy properties. This core set includes cosmological accretion, strong stellar-driven winds that are more efficient at low masses, black hole feedback that preferentially suppresses star formation at high masses, and structural and morphological evolution through merging and environmental processes. However, all cosmological models currently adopt phenomenological implementations of many of these core processes, which must be tuned to observations. Many details of how these diverse processes interact within a hierarchical structure formation setting remain poorly understood. Emerging multi-scale simulations are helping to bridge the gap between stellar and cosmological scales, placing models on a firmer, more physically grounded footing. Concurrently, upcoming telescope facilities will provide new challenges and constraints for models, particularly by directly constraining inflows and outflows through observations of gas in and around galaxies.},

Firefly is a chi-squared minimisation fitting code that fits combinations of single-burst stellar population models to spectroscopic data, following an iterative best-fitting process controlled by the Bayesian Information Criterion. No priors are applied, rather all solutions within a statistical cut are retained with their weight. Moreover, no additive or multiplicative polynomia are employed to adjust the spectral shape. This fitting freedom is envisaged in order to map out the effect of intrinsic spectral energy distribution (SED) degeneracies, such as age, metallicity, dust reddening on galaxy properties, and to quantify the effect of varying input model components on such properties. Dust attenuation is included using a new procedure, which was tested on Integral Field Spectroscopic (IFS) data in a previous paper. The fitting method is extensively tested with a comprehensive suite of mock galaxies, real galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and Milky Way globular clusters. We also assess the robustness of the derived properties as a function of signal-to-noise ratio and adopted wavelength range. We show that $\backslash$FF$\backslash$ is able to recover age, metallicity, stellar mass and even the star formation history remarkably well down to a \$S/N$\backslash$sim5\$, for moderately dusty systems.

analysis is based on precise 30-band photometricredshifts. By comparing
these photometric redshifts with 10,800 spectroscopic redshifts from the
zCOSMOS bright and faint surveys, we find a precision of
$\sigma\Delta$z/(1 + z) = 0.008 at i+ $<$ 22.5
and $\sigma\Delta$z/(1 + z) = 0.03 at 1.5 $<$ z $<$ 4. We
derive the stellar mass function and correct for the Eddington bias. We
find a mass-dependent evolution of the global and star-forming
populations, with the low-mass end of the mass functions evolving more
rapidly than the high-mass end. This mass-dependent evolution is a
direct consequence of the star formation being "quenched" in galaxies
more massive than $\mathscr{M}$ $\greaterequivlnt$ 1010.7 -
10.9$\mathscr{M}\odot$. For the mass function of the
quiescent galaxies, we do not find any significant evolution of the
high-mass end at z $<$ 1; however we observe a clear flattening of the
faint-end slope. From z \textasciitilde{} 3 to z \textasciitilde{} 1, the density of quiescent galaxies
increases over the entire mass range. Their comoving stellar mass
density increases by 1.6 dex between z \textasciitilde{} 3 and z \textasciitilde{} 1 and by less than
0.2 dex at z $<$ 1. We infer the star formation history from the mass
density evolution. This inferred star formation history is in excellent
agreement with instantaneous star formation rate measurements at z $<$
1.5, while we find differences of 0.2 dex at z $>$ 1.5 consistent with
the expected uncertainties. We also develop a new method to infer the
specific star formation rate from the mass function of star-forming
galaxies. We find that the specific star formation rate of 1010 -
10.5$\mathscr{M}\odot$ galaxies increases continuously in
the redshift range 1 $<$ z $<$ 4. Finally, we compare our results with
a semi-analytical model and find that these models overestimate the
density of low mass quiescent galaxies by an order of magnitude, while
the density of low-mass star-forming galaxies is successfully
reproduced.

measurements and show that the stellar mass density of the universe was
only 50\%, 10\%, and 1\% of its current value at z \textasciitilde{} 0.75, 2.0, and 3.5,
respectively. The quiescent population drives most of the overall
growth, with the stellar mass density of these galaxies increasing as
$\rho$starvprop(1 + z)-4.7 $\pm$ 0.4 since
z = 3.5, whereas the mass density of star-forming galaxies increases as
$\rho$starvprop(1 + z)-2.3 $\pm$ 0.2. At z
$>$ 2.5, star-forming galaxies dominate the total SMF at all stellar
masses, although a non-zero population of quiescent galaxies persists to
z = 4. Comparisons of the Ks -selected star-forming galaxy
SMFs with UV-selected SMFs at 2.5 $<$ z $<$ 4 show reasonable
agreement and suggest that UV-selected samples are representative of the
majority of the stellar mass density at z $>$ 3.5. We estimate the
average mass growth of individual galaxies by selecting galaxies at
fixed cumulative number density. The average galaxy with log(M
star/M $\odot$) = 11.5 at z = 0.3 has grown in
mass by only 0.2 dex (0.3 dex) since z = 2.0 (3.5), whereas those with
log(M star/M $\odot$) = 10.5 have grown by $>$1.0
dex since z = 2. At z $<$ 2, the time derivatives of the mass growth
are always larger for lower-mass galaxies, which demonstrates that the
mass growth in galaxies since that redshift is mass-dependent and
primarily bottom-up. Lastly, we examine potential sources of systematic
uncertainties in the SMFs and find that those from photo-z templates,
stellar population synthesis modeling, and the definition of quiescent
galaxies dominate the total error budget in the SMFs.

mass-luminosity relation, at high mass, particularly for first brightest
galaxies and less so for group total, is almost independent of the
actual luminosity function considered, when luminosity is scaled by the
characteristic luminosity L*. Additionally, the shape of the
total luminosity depends on the slope of the SHMF. For these high mass,
cluster-sized haloes, we find that total luminosity scales as
Ltot \textasciitilde{}M0.88, while the luminosity of the first
brightest galaxy has a much weaker dependence on halo mass,
L1 \textasciitilde{} M0.28, in good agreement with observations
and previous results. At low mass, the resulting slope of the
mass-luminosity relation depends strongly of the faint end slope of the
luminosity function, and we obtain a steep relation, with approximately
L \textasciitilde{} M4.5 for M \textasciitilde{}
1010h-1Msolar in the K band. The
average number of galaxies per halo/cluster is also in very good
agreement with observations, scaling as \textasciitilde{}M0.9.

In general, we obtain a good agreement with several independent sets of
observational data. Taking the model as essentially correct, we consider
two additional possible sources for remaining discrepancies: problems
with the underlying cosmology and with the observational mass
determination. We find that, when comparing with observations and for a
flat cosmology, the model tends to prefer lower values for
$\Omega$m and $\sigma$8. Within the Wilkinson
Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) + Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)
concordance plane of Tegmark et al., we find best agreement around
$\Omega$m = 0.25 and $\sigma$8 = 0.8; this is also
in very good agreement with the results of the cosmic microwave
background (CMB)+2dF study of Sanchez et al. We also check on possible
corrections for observed mass based on a comparison of the equivalent
number of haloes/clusters. Additionally, we include further checks on
the model results based on the mass-to-light ratio, the occupation
number, the group luminosity function and the multiplicity function.},

roughly parallels that of haloes at z $<$ 1.6. We also track the
detailed merger histories of individual galaxies and measure the likelihood of multiple mergers per halo or subhalo. We examine satellite merger statistics in detail: 15-35 per cent of all recently merged galaxies are satellites, and satellites are twice as likely as centrals to have had a recent major merger. Finally, we show how the differing evolution of the merger rates of haloes and galaxies leads to the evolution of the average satellite occupation per halo, noting that for a fixed halo mass, the satellite halo occupation peaks at z \textasciitilde{} 2.5.},

  abstract = {Advances in observational capabilities have ushered in a new era of multi-wavelength, multi-physics probes of galaxy clusters and ambitious surveys are compiling large samples of cluster candidates selected in different ways. We use a high-resolution N-body simulation to study how the influence of large-scale structure in and around clusters causes correlated signals in different physical probes and discuss some implications this has for multi-physics probes of clusters (e.g. richness, lensing, Compton distortion and velocity dispersion).

We pay particular attention to velocity dispersions, matching galaxies to subhaloes which are explicitly tracked in the simulation. We find that not only do haloes persist as subhaloes when they fall into a larger host, but groups of subhaloes retain their identity for long periods within larger host haloes. The highly anisotropic nature of infall into massive clusters, and their triaxiality, translates into an anisotropic velocity ellipsoid: line-of-sight galaxy velocity
dispersions for any individual halo show large variance depending on viewing angle. The orientation of the velocity ellipsoid is correlated with the large-scale structure, and thus velocity outliers correlate with outliers caused by projection in other probes. We quantify this orientation uncertainty and give illustrative examples. Such a large variance suggests that velocity dispersion estimators will work better in an ensemble sense than for any individual cluster, which may inform strategies for obtaining redshifts of cluster members. We similarly find that the ability of substructure indicators to find kinematic
substructures is highly viewing angle dependent. While groups of subhaloes which merge with a larger host halo can retain their identity for many Gyr, they are only sporadically picked up by substructure indicators.

We discuss the effects of correlated scatter on scaling relations estimated through stacking, both analytically and in the simulations, showing that the strong correlation of measures with mass and the large scatter in mass at fixed observable mitigate line-of-sight projections.},

Because, according to the current scenario of structure formation, galaxy groups are associated with cold dark matter (CDM) haloes, we make use of the properties of the halo population in the design of our group finder. The method starts with an assumed mass-to-light ratio to assign a tentative mass to each group. This mass is used to estimate the size and velocity dispersion of the underlying halo that hosts the group, which in turn is used to determine group membership (in redshift space). This procedure is repeated until no further changes occur in group memberships. We find that the final groups selected this way are insensitive to the mass-to-light ratio assumed. We use mock catalogues, constructed using the conditional luminosity function (CLF), to test the performance of our group finder in terms of completeness of true members and contamination by
interlopers. Our group finder is more successful than the conventional friends-of-friends (FOF) group finder in assigning galaxies in common dark matter haloes to a single group. We apply our group finder to the 2-degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS) and compare the resulting group properties with model predictions based on the CLF. For the $\Lambda$CDM concordance cosmology, we find a clear discrepancy between
the model and data in the sense that the model predicts too many rich groups. In order to match the observational results, we have to either increase the mass-to-light ratios of rich clusters to a level
significantly higher than current observational estimates, or to assume $\sigma$8\textasciitilde{}= 0.7, compared with the concordance value of 0.9.},

the fidelity of group catalogue inferred statistics, we run three
different group finders used in the literature over a mock that includes
galaxy colours in a realistic manner. Overall, the resulting mock group
catalogues are remarkably similar, and most colour-dependent statistics
are recovered with reasonable accuracy. However, it is also clear that
certain systematic errors arise as a consequence of correlated errors in
group membership determination, central/satellite designation, and halo
mass assignment. We introduce a new statistic, the halo transition
probability (HTP), which captures the combined impact of all these
errors. As a rule of thumb, errors tend to equalize the properties of
distinct galaxy populations (i.e. red versus blue galaxies or centrals
versus satellites), and to result in inferred occupation statistics that
are more accurate for red galaxies than for blue galaxies. A statistic
that is particularly poorly recovered from the group catalogues is the
red fraction of central galaxies as a function of halo mass. Group
finders do a good job in recovering galactic conformity, but also have a
tendency to introduce weak conformity when none is present. We conclude
that proper inference of colour-dependent statistics from group
catalogues is best achieved using forward modelling (i.e. running group
finders over mock data) or by implementing a correction scheme based on
the HTP, as long as the latter is not too strongly model dependent.},

clustering of groups/clusters, we show that central galaxies show
enhanced SFR quenching out to 2.5 virial radii beyond groups/clusters,
and we demonstrate that this extended environmental enhancement can be
explained simply by ‘ejected' satellite galaxies that orbit beyond their
host halo's virial radius. We show that ejected satellites typically
orbit for several Gyr beyond the virial radius before falling back in,
and thus they compose up to 40 per cent of all central galaxies near
groups/clusters. We show that a model in which ejected satellites
experience the same SFR quenching as satellites within a host halo can
explain essentially all environmental dependence of galaxy quenching.
Furthermore, ejected satellites (continue to) lose significant halo
mass, an effect that is potentially observable via gravitational
lensing. The SFRs/colours and stellar-to-halo masses of ejected
satellites highlight the importance of environmental history and present
challenges to models of galaxy occupation that ignore such history.},

SSFR distribution, with a strong break at SSFR $\approx$ 10-11
yr-1 and the same high SSFR peak; in no regime is there ever
an excess of galaxies in the 'green valley'. Satellite galaxies are
simply more likely to lie on the quenched ('red sequence') side of the
SSFR distribution. Furthermore, the satellite quenched fraction excess
above the field galaxy value is nearly independent of galaxy stellar
mass. An enhanced quenched fraction for satellites persists in groups
with halo masses down to 3 \texttimes{} 1011 M$\odot$ and
increases strongly with halo mass and towards halo centre. We find no
detectable quenching enhancement for galaxies beyond \texttildelow{}2
Rvir around massive clusters once these galaxies have been
decomposed into centrals and satellites. These trends imply that (1)
galaxies experience no significant environmental effects until they
cross within \texttildelow{}Rvir of a more massive host halo; (2)
after this, star formation in active satellites continues to evolve in
the same manner as active central galaxies for several Gyr; and (3) once

method for aperture correction using resolved imaging and show that our method takes out essentially all aperture bias in the star formation rate (SFR) estimates, allowing an accurate estimate of the total SFRs in galaxies. We determine the SFR density to be

low-redshift Universe takes place in moderately massive galaxies (1010-1011 Msolar), typically in high surface brightness disc galaxies. Roughly 15 per cent of all star formation takes place in galaxies that show some sign of an active nucleus. About 20 per cent occurs in starburst galaxies. By focusing on the SFR per unit mass we show that the present to past average SFR, the Scalo b-parameter, is almost constant over almost three orders of magnitude in mass, declining only at M* $>$ 1010 Msolar. The volume averaged b parameter is
0.408+0.005-0.002

cosmology the present-day Universe is forming stars at at least 1/3 of its past average rate. For an exponentially declining cosmic star formation history this corresponds to a time-scale of
7+0.7-1.5 Gyr. In agreement with other work we find a correlation between b and morphological type, as well as a tight correlation between the 4000-\AA{}break (D4000) and b. We discuss how D4000 can be used to estimate b parameters for high-redshift galaxies.},

  abstract = {We review recent determinations of the present-day mass function (PDMF) and initial mass function (IMF) in various components of the
Galaxy-disk, spheroid, young, and globular clusters-and in conditions characteristic of early star formation. As a general feature, the IMF is found to depend weakly on the environment and to be well described by a power-law form for m$>$\textasciitilde{}1 Msolar and a lognormal form below, except possibly for early star formation conditions. The disk IMF for single objects has a characteristic mass around mc\textasciitilde{}0.08 Msolar and a variance in logarithmic mass $\sigma$\textasciitilde{}0.7,
whereas the IMF for multiple systems has mc\textasciitilde{}0.2
Msolar and $\sigma$\textasciitilde{}0.6. The extension of the single MF into the brown dwarf regime is in good agreement with present estimates of L- and T-dwarf densities and yields a disk brown dwarf number density comparable to the stellar one, nBD\textasciitilde{}n*\textasciitilde{}0.1
pc-3. The IMF of young clusters is found to be consistent with the disk field IMF, providing the same correction for unresolved binaries, confirming the fact that young star clusters and disk field stars represent the same stellar population. Dynamical effects, yielding depletion of the lowest mass objects, are found to become consequential for ages $>$\textasciitilde{}130 Myr. The spheroid IMF relies on much less robust
grounds. The large metallicity spread in the local subdwarf photometric sample, in particular, remains puzzling. Recent observations suggest that there is a continuous kinematic shear between the thick-disk population, present in local samples, and the genuine spheroid one. This enables us to derive only an upper limit for the spheroid mass density and IMF. Within all the uncertainties, the latter is found to be similar to the one derived for globular clusters and is well represented also by a lognormal form with a characteristic mass slightly larger than for the disk, mc\textasciitilde{}0.2-0.3 Msolar, excluding a significant population of brown dwarfs in globular clusters and in the spheroid. The IMF characteristic of early star formation at large redshift remains undetermined, but different observational constraints suggest that it does not extend below \textasciitilde{}1 Msolar. These results suggest a characteristic mass for star formation that decreases with time, from conditions prevailing at large redshift to conditions characteristic of the spheroid (or thick disk) to present-day conditions. These
conclusions, however, remain speculative, given the large uncertainties in the spheroid and early star IMF determinations.

These IMFs allow a reasonably robust determination of the Galactic present-day and initial stellar and brown dwarf contents. They also have important galactic implications beyond the Milky Way in yielding more accurate mass-to-light ratio determinations. The mass-to-light ratios obtained with the disk and the spheroid IMF yield values 1.8-1.4 times smaller than for a Salpeter IMF, respectively, in agreement with various recent dynamical determinations. This general IMF determination is examined in the context of star formation theory. None of the theories based on a Jeans-type mechanism, where fragmentation is due only to gravity, can fulfill all the observational constraints on star formation and predict a large number of substellar objects. On the other hand, recent numerical simulations of compressible turbulence, in particular in super-Alfv\'enic conditions, seem to reproduce both
qualitatively and quantitatively the stellar and substellar IMF and thus provide an appealing theoretical foundation. In this picture, star formation is induced by the dissipation of large-scale turbulence to smaller scales through radiative MHD shocks, producing filamentary structures. These shocks produce local nonequilibrium structures with large density contrasts, which collapse eventually in gravitationally bound objects under the combined influence of turbulence and gravity. The concept of a single Jeans mass is replaced by a distribution of local Jeans masses, representative of the lognormal probability density function of the turbulent gas. Objects below the mean thermal Jeans mass still have a possibility to collapse, although with a decreasing probability.

  volume = {1107},
  abstract = {The properties of dark matter halos, including mass growth, correlate with larger scale environment at fixed mass, an effect known as assembly bias. However, whether this environmental dependence manifests itself in galaxy properties remains unclear. We apply a group-finding algorithm to DR7 of the SDSS to estimate the halo mass of each galaxy and to
decompose galaxies into those that exist at the centers of distinct halos and those that orbit as satellites within larger halos. Using the 4000-A break as a measure of star formation history, we examine the correlation between the quenched fraction of galaxies, f\_q, and
large-scale environment, rho. At all galaxy magnitudes, there is a positive, monotonic relationship between f\_q and rho. We use the group catalog to decompose this correlation into the contribution from central and satellite galaxies as a function of halo mass. Because satellites are more likely to be quenched than central galaxies, the observed f\_q-rho correlation is primarily due to variations of the halo mass function with environment, which causes a larger fraction of satellite galaxies at high rho. For low-mass central galaxies (Mgal $<$\textasciitilde{} 10\^10.0 Msol/h\^2), there is no correlation between f\_q and rho. These results are inconsistent with the strong assembly bias of dark matter halos seen in this mass regime if recent galaxy growth at all correlates with recent halo growth, as we demonstrate through a high resolution N-body simulation. We also find that the mean stellar age of quenched central galaxies is independent of rho at fixed Mgal, while the formation times of low mass halos vary significantly. We conclude that the processes that halt the star formation of low mass central galaxies are not correlated to the formation histories of their host halos, and old galaxies do not reside preferentially in old halos.

We include a co-addition of the best of these data, going roughly 2 mag fainter than the main survey over 250
deg2. The survey has completed spectroscopy over 9380 deg2 the spectroscopy is now complete over a large contiguous area of the Northern Galactic Cap, closing the gap that was present in previous data releases. There are over 1.6 million spectra in total, including 930,000 galaxies, 120,000 quasars, and 460,000 stars. The data release includes improved stellar photometry at low Galactic latitude. The astrometry has all been recalibrated with the second version of the USNO CCD Astrograph Catalog, reducing the rms statistical errors at the bright end to 45 milliarcseconds per coordinate. We further quantify a systematic error in bright galaxy photometry due to poor sky
determination; this problem is less severe than previously reported for the majority of galaxies. Finally, we describe a series of improvements to the spectroscopic reductions, including better flat fielding and improved wavelength calibration at the blue end, better processing of objects with extremely strong narrow emission lines, and an improved determination of stellar metallicities.},

  abstract = {Here we present the New York University Value-Added Galaxy Catalog 
(NYU-VAGC), a catalog of local galaxies (mostly below z\textasciitilde{}0.3) based on a
set of publicly released surveys matched to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS) Data Release 2. The photometric catalog consists of 693,319
galaxies, QSOs, and stars; 343,568 of these have redshift
determinations, mostly from the SDSS. Excluding areas masked by bright
stars, the photometric sample covers 3514 deg2, and the
spectroscopic sample covers 2627 deg2 (with about 85\%
completeness). Earlier, proprietary versions of this catalog have formed
the basis of many SDSS investigations of the power spectrum, correlation
function, and luminosity function of galaxies. Future releases will
follow future public releases of the SDSS. The catalog includes matches
to the Two Micron All Sky Survey Point Source Catalog and Extended
Source Catalog, the IRAS Point Source Catalog Redshift Survey, the
Two-Degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey, the Third Reference Catalogue
of Bright Galaxies, and the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty cm
survey. We calculate and compile derived quantities from the images and
spectra of the galaxies in the catalogs (for example, K-corrections and
structural parameters for the galaxies). The SDSS catalog presented here
is photometrically calibrated in a more consistent way than that
distributed by the SDSS Data Release 2 Archive Servers and is thus more
appropriate for large-scale structure statistics, reducing systematic
calibration errors across the sky from \textasciitilde{}2\% to \textasciitilde{}1\%. We include an
explicit description of the geometry of the catalog, including all
imaging and targeting information as a function of sky position.
Finally, we have performed eyeball quality checks on a large number of
objects in the catalog in order to flag errors (such as errors in
deblending). This catalog is complementary to the SDSS Archive Servers
in that NYU-VAGC's calibration, geometric description, and conveniently
small size are specifically designed for studying galaxy properties and
large-scale structure statistics using the SDSS spectroscopic catalog.

  abstract = {I use the abundance matching ansatz, which has proven to be successful in reproducing galaxy clustering and other statistics, to derive estimates of the virial radius, R 200, for galaxies of different morphological types and a wide range of stellar masses. I show that over eight orders of magnitude in stellar mass galaxies of all morphological types follow an approximately linear relation between half-mass radius of their stellar distribution, r 1/2, and virial radius, r 1/2 $\approx$ 0.015 R 200, with
scatter of $\approx$0.2 dex. Such scaling is in remarkable agreement with the expectation of models that assume that galaxy sizes are controlled by halo angular momentum, r 1/2vprop$\lambda$R 200,
where $\lambda$ is the spin of galaxy parent halo. The scatter about the relation is comparable with the scatter expected from the distribution of $\lambda$. Moreover, I show that when the stellar and gas surface
density profiles of galaxies of different morphological types are rescaled by the radius rn = 0.015 R 200, the rescaled profiles follow approximately universal exponential (for late types) and de Vaucouleurs (for early types) form with scatter of only $\approx$30\%-50\% at R $\approx$ 1-3rn . Remarkably, both late- and
early-type galaxies have similar mean stellar surface density profiles at R $>$\textasciitilde{} 1rn . The main difference between their stellar distributions is thus at R $<$ rn . The results of this study imply that galaxy sizes and radial distribution of baryons are shaped primarily by properties of their parent halos and that the sizes of both late-type disks and early-type spheroids are controlled by halo angular momentum.},

  abstract = {The cosmic accretion of both dark matter and baryons into halos is 
typically measured using some evolving virial relation, but recent work
suggests that most halo growth at late cosmic time (z$\lessequivlnt$ 2) is not
physical but is rather the by-product of an evolving virial radius
(``pseudo-evolution''). Using Omega25, a suite of cosmological
simulations that incorporate both dark matter and gas dynamics with
differing treatments of gas cooling, star formation, and thermal
feedback, we systematically explore the physics that governs cosmic
accretion into halos and their galaxies. Physically meaningful cosmic
accretion of both dark matter and baryons occurs at z$\greaterequivlnt$ 1 across our
halo mass range: \{M\}200\{\{m\}\}=\{10\}11-14
\{$\backslash$text\{\}\}\{M\}$\odot$ . However, dark matter, because it is
dissipationless, is deposited (in a time-average sense) at $\greaterequivlnt$
\{R\}200\{\{m\}\}(z) in a shell-like manner, such that dark matter
mass and density experience little-to-no physical growth at any radius
within a halo at z$\backslash$lt 1. In contrast, gas, because it is able to cool
radiatively, experiences significant accretion at all radii, at a rate
that roughly tracks the accretion rate at \{R\}200\{\{m\}\}, at all
redshifts. Infalling gas starts to decouple from dark matter at $\approx$ 2
\{R\}200\{\{m\}\} and continues to accrete to smaller radii until
the onset of strong angular-momentum support at $\approx$ 0.1
\{R\}200\{\{m\}\}. Thus, while the growth of dark matter is subject
to pseudo-evolution, the growth of baryons is not. The fact that the
accretion rate of gas on galactic scales tracks the accretion rate near
\{R\}200\{\{m\}\} provides insight into the tight relations between
the masses/sizes of galaxies and those of their host halos across cosmic
time.},

  abstract = {In hierarchical structure formation, dark matter halos that merge with larger halos can persist as subhalos. These subhalos are likely hosts of visible galaxies. While the dense halo environment rapidly strips subhalos of their dark mass, the compact luminous material can remain intact for some time, making the correspondence of galaxies with severely stripped subhalos unclear. Many galaxy evolution models assume that satellite galaxies eventually merge with their central galaxy, but this ignores the possibility of satellite tidal disruption. We use a high-resolution \$N\$-body simulation of cosmological volume to explore satellite galaxy merging/disruption criteria based on dark matter subhalo dynamics. We explore the impact that satellite merging/disruption has on the Halo Occupation Distribution and radial profile of the remnants. Using abundance matching to assign stellar mass/luminosity to subhalos, we compare with observed galaxy clustering, satellite fractions, cluster satellite luminosity functions, finding that subhalos reproduce well these observables on all scales. Our results imply that satellite subhalos corresponding to $>$0.2L* galaxies must be well-resolved down to 1-3\% of their mass at infall to robustly trace the galaxy population. We also explore a simple analytic model based on dynamical friction for satellite galaxy infall, finding good agreement with our subhalo catalog and observations.},

From these mass growth histories, we are able to measure the time at which half the total stellar mass of the descendant galaxy was assembled, \$t\_\{a\}\$, which, in order of decreasing mass corresponds to redshifts of \$z\_\{a\}=1.28, 0.92, 0.60\$ and \$0.51\$. We compare this to the median light-weighted stellar age \$t\_\{*\}\$ (\$z\_\{*\} = 2.08, 1.49, 0.82\$ and \$0.37\$) of a sample of low redshift SDSS galaxies (from the literature) and find the timescales are consistent with more massive galaxies forming a higher fraction of their stars ex-situ compared to lower mass descendants. We find that both \$t\_\{*\}\$ and \$t\_\{a\}\$ strongly correlate with mass which is in contrast to what is found in the EAGLE hydrodynamical simulation which shows a flat relationship between \$t\_\{a\}\$ and \$M\_\{*\}\$. However, the semi-analytic model of $\backslash$citet\{henriques2015\} is consistent with the observations in both \$t\_\{a\}\$ and \$t\_\{*\}\$ with \$M\_\{*\}\$, showing the most recent semi-analytic models are better able to decouple the evolution of the baryons from the dark matter in lower-mass galaxies.},

galaxies and their host dark matter halos, as characterized by the
stellar mass-halo mass (SM-HM) relation, with rigorous consideration of
uncertainties. Our analysis focuses on results from the abundance
matching technique, which assumes that every dark matter halo or subhalo
above a specific mass threshold hosts one galaxy. We provide a robust
estimate of the SM-HM relation for 0 $<$ z $<$ 1 and discuss the
quantitative effects of uncertainties in observed galaxy stellar mass
functions (including stellar mass estimates and counting uncertainties),
halo mass functions (including cosmology and uncertainties from
substructure), and the abundance matching technique used to link
galaxies to halos (including scatter in this connection). Our analysis
results in a robust estimate of the SM-HM relation and its evolution
from z = 0 to z = 4. The shape and the evolution are well constrained
for z $<$ 1. The largest uncertainties at these redshifts are due to
stellar mass estimates (0.25 dex uncertainty in normalization); however,
failure to account for scatter in stellar masses at fixed halo mass can
lead to errors of similar magnitude in the SM-HM relation for central
galaxies in massive halos. We also investigate the SM-HM relation to z =
4, although the shape of the relation at higher redshifts remains fairly
unconstrained when uncertainties are taken into account. We find that
the integrated star formation at a given halo mass peaks at 10\%-20\% of
available baryons for all redshifts from 0 to 4. This peak occurs at a
halo mass of 7 \texttimes{} 1011 M sun at z = 0 and
this mass increases by a factor of 5 to z = 4. At lower and higher
masses, star formation is substantially less efficient, with stellar
mass scaling as M * \textasciitilde{} M 2.3 h at low
masses and M * \textasciitilde{} M 0.29 h at high
masses. The typical stellar mass for halos with mass less than
1012 M sun has increased by 0.3-0.45 dex for halos

The conditional stellar mass function (CSMF), which
describes the stellar distribution of galaxies in halos of a given mass for central and satellite galaxies can be well modeled with a log-normal distribution and a modified Schechter form, respectively. On average, there are about three times as many central galaxies as satellites. Among the satellite population, there are in general more red galaxies than blue ones. For the central population, the luminosity function is dominated by red galaxies at the massive end, and by blue galaxies at the low-mass end. At the very low mass end (M * lsim
109 h -2 M sun), however, there is a marked increase in the number of red centrals. We speculate that these galaxies are located close to large halos so that their star formation is truncated by the large-scale environments. The stellar mass function of galaxy groups is well described by a double power law, with a characteristic stellar mass at \textasciitilde{}4 \texttimes{} 1010 h

Using galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we investigate the halo mass-luminosity relation (MLR) and the halo mass-stellar mass relation (MSR) of central galaxies. In particular, we focus on the dependence of these scaling relations on the colour of the central galaxy. We find that red central galaxies on average occupy more massive haloes than blue central galaxies of the same luminosity. However, at fixed stellar mass there is no appreciable difference in the average halo mass of red and blue centrals, especially for M*$\lessequivlnt$ 1010.5
h-2 M$\odot$. This indicates that stellar mass is a better indicator of halo mass than luminosity. Nevertheless, we find that the scatter in halo masses at fixed stellar mass is non-negligible for both red and blue centrals. It increases as a function of stellar mass for red centrals but shows a fairly constant behaviour for blue centrals. We compare the scaling relations obtained in this paper with results from other independent studies of satellite kinematics, with results from a SDSS galaxy group catalog, from galaxy-galaxy weak lensing measurements and from subhalo abundance matching studies. Overall, these different techniques yield MLRs and MSRs in fairly good agreement with each other (typically within a factor of 2), indicating that we are converging on an accurate and reliable description of the galaxy-dark matter connection.

of galaxy-galaxy weak lensing, galaxy spatial clustering, and galaxy
number densities. Carefully accounting for sample variance and for
scatter between stellar and halo mass, we model all three observables
simultaneously using a novel and self-consistent theoretical framework.
Our results provide strong constraints on the shape and redshift
evolution of the stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) from z = 0.2 to z
= 1. At low stellar mass, we find that halo mass scales as Mh
vpropM 0.46 * and that this scaling does not
evolve significantly with redshift from z = 0.2 to z = 1. The slope of
the SHMR rises sharply at M * $>$ 5 \texttimes{} 1010
M $\odot$ and as a consequence, the stellar mass of a central
galaxy becomes a poor tracer of its parent halo mass. We show that the
dark-to-stellar ratio, Mh /M *, varies from low to
high masses, reaching a minimum of Mh /M * \textasciitilde{} 27 at
M * = 4.5 \texttimes{} 1010 M $\odot$ and
Mh = 1.2 \texttimes{} 1012 M $\odot$. This
minimum is important for models of galaxy formation because it marks the
mass at which the accumulated stellar growth of the central galaxy has
been the most efficient. We describe the SHMR at this minimum in terms
of the "pivot stellar mass," M piv *, the "pivot
halo mass," M piv h , and the "pivot ratio,"
(Mh /M *)piv. Thanks to a homogeneous
analysis of a single data set spanning a large redshift range, we report
the first detection of mass downsizing trends for both M piv
 h and M piv *. The pivot stellar mass
decreases from M piv * = 5.75 $\pm$ 0.13

piv * = 3.55 $\pm$ 0.17 \texttimes{} 1010

evolution of M piv h leaves the pivot ratio
constant with redshift at (Mh /M *)piv
\textasciitilde{} 27. We use simple arguments to show how this result raises the
possibility that star formation quenching may ultimately depend on
Mh /M * and not simply on Mh , as is
commonly assumed. We show that simple models with such a dependence
naturally lead to downsizing in the sites of star formation. Finally, we
discuss the implications of our results in the context of popular
quenching models, including disk instabilities and active galactic
nucleus feedback.

  abstract = {We provide new constraints on the connection between galaxies in the 
local universe, identified by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and dark
matter halos and their constituent substructures in the $\Lambda$-cold
dark matter model using WMAP7 cosmological parameters. Predictions for
the abundance and clustering properties of dark matter halos, and the
relationship between dark matter hosts and substructures, are based on a
high-resolution cosmological simulation, the Bolshoi simulation. We
associate galaxies with dark matter halos and subhalos using subhalo
abundance matching, and perform a comprehensive analysis which
investigates the underlying assumptions of this technique including (1)
which halo property is most closely associated with galaxy stellar
masses and luminosities, (2) how much scatter is in this relationship,
and (3) how much subhalos can be stripped before their galaxies are
destroyed. The models are jointly constrained by new measurements of the
projected two-point galaxy clustering and the observed conditional
stellar mass function of galaxies in groups. We find that an abundance
matching model that associates galaxies with the peak circular velocity
of their halos is in good agreement with the data, when scatter of 0.20
$\pm$ 0.03 dex in stellar mass at a given peak velocity is included.
This confirms the theoretical expectation that the stellar mass of
galaxies is tightly correlated with the potential wells of their dark
matter halos before they are impacted by larger structures. The data put
tight constraints on the satellite fraction of galaxies as a function of
galaxy stellar mass and on the scatter between halo and galaxy
properties, and rule out several alternative abundance matching models
that have been considered. This will yield important constraints for
galaxy formation models, and also provides encouraging indications that
the galaxy-halo connection can be modeled with sufficient fidelity for
future precision studies of the dark universe.},

  abstract = {Standard approaches to Bayesian parameter inference in large scale structure assume a Gaussian functional form (chi-squared form) for the likelihood. This assumption, in detail, cannot be correct. Likelihood free inferences such as Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) relax these restrictions and make inference possible without making any assumptions on the likelihood. Instead ABC relies on a forward generative model of the data and a metric for measuring the distance between the model and data. In this work, we demonstrate that ABC is feasible for LSS parameter inference by using it to constrain parameters of the halo occupation distribution (HOD) model for populating dark matter halos with galaxies. Using specific implementation of ABC supplemented with Population Monte Carlo importance sampling, a generative forward model using HOD, and a distance metric based on galaxy number density, two-point correlation function, and galaxy group multiplicity function, we constrain the HOD parameters of mock observation generated from selected "true" HOD parameters. The parameter constraints we obtain from ABC are consistent with the "true" HOD parameters, demonstrating that ABC can be reliably used for parameter inference in LSS. Furthermore, we compare our ABC constraints to constraints we obtain using a pseudo-likelihood function of Gaussian form with MCMC and find consistent HOD parameter constraints. Ultimately our results suggest that ABC can and should be applied in parameter inference for LSS analyses.},

Galaxy abundances are well determined over almost four orders of magnitude in stellar mass and are reasonably but not perfectly fit by a Schechter function with
characteristic stellar mass m* = 6.7 \texttimes{}
1010Msolar and with faint-end slope $\alpha$ =
-1.155. For a standard cosmology and a standard stellar initial mass function, only 3.5 per cent of the baryons in the low-redshift Universe are locked up in stars. The projected autocorrelation function of stellar mass is robustly and precisely determined for rp $<$ 30h-1Mpc. Over the range 10h-1kpc $<$
rp $<$ 10h-1Mpc, it is extremely well represented by a power law. The corresponding three-dimensional autocorrelation function is $\xi$*(r) = (r/6.1h-1Mpc)-1.84.
Relative to the dark matter, the bias of the stellar mass distribution is approximately constant on large scales, but varies by a factor of 5 for rp $<$ 1h-1Mpc. This behaviour is
approximately but not perfectly reproduced by current models for galaxy formation in the concordance $\Lambda$cold dark matter cosmology.
Detailed comparison suggests that a fluctuation amplitude

star formation rates (SFRs) and lie on the ‘red sequence' than central
(‘field') galaxies. Using galaxy group/cluster catalogues from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7, together with a high-resolution,
cosmological N-body simulation to track satellite orbits, we examine the
star formation histories and quenching time-scales of satellites of
Mstar $>$ 5 \texttimes{} 109 M$\odot$ at z
$\approx$ 0. We first explore satellite infall histories: group preprocessing
and ejected orbits are critical aspects of satellite evolution, and
properly accounting for these, satellite infall typically occurred at z
\texttildelow{} 0.5, or \texttildelow{}5 Gyr ago. To obtain accurate initial conditions
for the SFRs of satellites at their time of first infall, we construct
an empirical parametrization for the evolution of central galaxy SFRs
and quiescent fractions. With this, we constrain the importance and
efficiency of satellite quenching as a function of satellite and host
halo mass, finding that satellite quenching is the dominant process for
building up all quiescent galaxies at Mstar $<$
1010 M$\odot$. We then constrain satellite star
formation histories, finding a ‘delayed-then-rapid' quenching scenario:
satellite SFRs evolve unaffected for 2-4 Gyr after infall, after which
star formation quenches rapidly, with an e-folding time of $<$0.8 Gyr.
These quenching time-scales are shorter for more massive satellites but
do not depend on host halo mass: the observed increase in the satellite
quiescent fraction with halo mass arises simply because of satellites
quenching in a lower mass group prior to infall (group preprocessing),
which is responsible for up to half of quenched satellites in massive
clusters. Because of the long time delay before quenching starts,
satellites experience significant stellar mass growth after infall,
nearly identical to central galaxies. This fact provides key physical
insight into the subhalo abundance matching method.},

We obtain dust-corrected SFRs by fitting the GALEX (UV) and SDSS (optical) photometry to a library of population synthesis models that include dust attenuation. For star-forming galaxies, our UV-based SFRs compare remarkably well with those derived from SDSS H alpha. Deviations from perfect agreement between these two methods are due to differences in the dust attenuation estimates. In contrast to H alpha, UV provides reliable SFRs for galaxies with weak or no H alpha emission, and where H alpha is contaminated with an emission from an AGN. We use full-SED SFRs to calibrate a simple prescription that uses GALEX UV magnitudes to produce good SFRs for normal star-forming galaxies. The specific SFR is considered as a function of stellar mass for (1) star-forming galaxies with no AGN, (2) those hosting an AGN, and for (3) galaxies without H alpha emission. We find that the three have distinct star formation histories, with AGN lying intermediate between the star-forming and the quiescent galaxies. Normal star forming galaxies (without an AGN) lie on a relatively narrow linear sequence. Remarkably, galaxies hosting a strong AGN appear to represent the massive continuation of this sequence. Weak AGN, while also massive, have lower SFR, sometimes extending to the realm of quiescent galaxies. We propose an evolutionary sequence for massive galaxies that smoothly connects normal star-forming galaxies to quiescent (red sequence) galaxies via strong and weak AGN. We confirm that some galaxies with no H alpha emission show signs of SF in the UV. We derive a UV-based cosmic SFR density at z=0.1 with smaller total error than previous measurements (abridged).},

We considered a sample of 24463 galaxies from the CANDELS/GOODS-S survey to conduct a detailed analysis of the SFR-M* relation at redshifts 0.5\$$\backslash$leqslant z$<$\$3 over more than three dex in stellar mass. To obtain SFR estimates, we utilized mid- and far-IR photometry when available, and rest-UV fluxes for all the other galaxies. We performed our analysis in different redshift bins, with two different methods: 1) a linear regression fitting of all star-forming galaxies, defined as those with specific star formation rates \$$\backslash$rm log\_\{10\}(sSFR/yr\^\{-1\}) $>$ -9.8\$, similarly to what is typically done in the literature; 2) a multi-Gaussian decomposition to identify the galaxy main sequence (MS), the starburst sequence and the quenched galaxy cloud. We found that the MS slope becomes flatter when higher stellar mass cuts are adopted, and that the apparent slope change observed at high masses depends on the SFR estimation method. In addition, the multi-Gaussian decomposition reveals the presence of a starburst population which increases towards low stellar masses and high redshifts. We found that starbursts make \textasciitilde{}5\% of all galaxies at z=0.5-1.0, while they account for \textasciitilde{}14\% of galaxies at 1$<$z$<$3 with log\$\_\{10\}(M\^\{*\})=\$8.25-11.25.

We combine a high resolution cosmological \$N\$-body simulation with observed evolutionary trends of the "star formation main sequence," quiescent fraction, and stellar mass function at \$z $<$ 1\$ to construct a model that statistically tracks the star formation histories and quenching of central galaxies. Comparing this model to the distribution of central galaxy star formation rates in a group catalog of the SDSS Data Release 7, we constrain the timescales over which physical processes cease star formation in central galaxies. Over the stellar mass range \$10\^\{9.5\}\$ to \$10\^\{11\} $\backslash$mathrm\{M\}\_$\backslash$odot\$ we infer quenching e-folding times that span \$1.5\$ to \$0.5$\backslash$; $\backslash$mathrm\{Gyr\}\$ with more massive central galaxies quenching faster.

Compared to satellites, central galaxies take \$$\backslash$sim 2\textasciitilde$\backslash$mathrm\{Gyrs\}\$ longer to quench their star formation, suggesting that different mechanisms are responsible for quenching centrals versus satellites. Finally, the central galaxy quenching timescale we infer provides key constraints for proposed star formation quenching mechanisms. Our timescale is generally consistent with gas depletion timescales predicted by quenching through strangulation. However, the exact physical mechanism(s) responsible for this still remain unclear.},

  title = {The Limited Role of Galaxy Mergers in Driving Stellar Mass Growth over Cosmic Time},
  abstract = {A key unresolved question is the role that galaxy mergers play in driving stellar mass growth over cosmic time. Recent observational work hints at the possibility that the overall contribution of ‘major' mergers (mass ratios \$$\backslash$gtrsim\$1:4) to cosmic stellar mass growth may be small, because they enhance star formation rates by relatively small amounts at high redshift, when much of today's stellar mass was assembled. However, the heterogeneity and relatively small size of today's datasets, coupled with the difficulty in identifying genuine mergers, makes it challenging to \$$\backslash$textit\{empirically\}\$ quantify the merger contribution to stellar mass growth. Here, we use Horizon-AGN, a cosmological hydrodynamical simulation, to comprehensively quantify the contribution of mergers to the star formation budget over the lifetime of the Universe. We show that: (1) both major and minor mergers enhance star formation to similar amounts, (2) the fraction of star formation directly attributable to merging is small at all redshifts (e.g. \$$\backslash$sim\$35 and \$$\backslash$sim\$20 per cent at z\$$\backslash$sim\$3 and z\$$\backslash$sim\$1 respectively) and (3) only \$$\backslash$sim\$25 per cent of today's stellar mass is directly attributable to galaxy mergers over cosmic time. Our results suggest that smooth accretion, not merging, is the dominant driver of stellar mass growth over the lifetime of the Universe.},

  abstract = {We present here a simple model for the star formation history (SFH) of 
galaxies that is successful in describing both the star formation rate
density (SFRD) over cosmic time, as well as the distribution of specific
star formation rates (sSFRs) of galaxies at the current epoch, and the
evolution of this quantity in galaxy populations to a redshift of z = 1.
We show first that the cosmic SFRD is remarkably well described by a
simple log-normal in time. We next postulate that this functional form
for the ensemble is also a reasonable description for the SFHs of
individual galaxies. Using the measured sSFRs for galaxies at z \textasciitilde{} 0 from
Paper III in this series, we then construct a realization of a universe
populated by such galaxies in which the parameters of the log-normal SFH
of each galaxy are adjusted to match the sSFRs at z \textasciitilde{} 0 as well as
fitting, in ensemble, the cosmic SFRD from z = 0 to z = 8. This model
predicts, with striking fidelity, the distribution of sSFRs in
mass-limited galaxy samples to z = 1; this match is not achieved by
other models with a different functional form for the SFHs of individual
galaxies, but with the same number of degrees of freedom, suggesting
that the log-normal form is well matched to the likely actual histories
of individual galaxies. We also impose the sSFR versus mass
distributions at higher redshifts from Paper III as constraints on the
model, and show that, as previously suggested, some galaxies in the
field, particularly low mass galaxies, are quite young at intermediate
redshifts. As emphasized in Paper III, starbursts are insufficient to
explain the enhanced sSFRs in intermediate redshift galaxies; we show
here that a model using only smoothly varying log-normal SFHs for
galaxies, which allows for some fraction of the population to have peak
star formation at late times, does however fully explain the
observations. Finally, we show that this model, constrained in detail
only at redshifts z $<$ 1, also produces the main sequence of
star-formation observed at 1.5 $<$ z $<$ 2.5, again suggesting that
the log-normal SFHs are a close approximation to the actual histories of
typical galaxies.},

stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) of star forming and quiescent

* $>$\textasciitilde{} 1010.6 M $\odot$, our results
indicate that star-forming galaxies grow proportionately as fast as
their dark matter halos while quiescent galaxies are outpaced by dark
matter growth. At lower masses, there is minimal difference in the
SHMRs, implying that the majority low-mass quiescent galaxies have only
recently been quenched of their star formation. Our analysis also
affords a breakdown of all COSMOS galaxies into the relative numbers of
central and satellite galaxies for both populations. At z = 1, satellite
galaxies dominate the red sequence below the knee in the stellar mass
function. But the number of quiescent satellites exhibits minimal
redshift evolution; all evolution in the red sequence is due to low-mass
central galaxies being quenched of their star formation. At M
* \textasciitilde{} 1010 M $\odot$, the fraction of
central galaxies on the red sequence increases by a factor of 10 over
our redshift baseline, while the fraction of quenched satellite galaxies
at that mass is constant with redshift. We define a "migration rate" to
the red sequence as the time derivative of the passive galaxy
abundances. We find that the migration rate of central galaxies to the
red sequence increases by nearly an order of magnitude from z = 1 to z =
0. These results imply that the efficiency of quenching star formation
for centrals is increasing with cosmic time, while the mechanisms that
quench the star formation of satellite galaxies in groups and clusters
is losing efficiency.},

  shorttitle = {Halo {{Histories}} vs. {{Galaxy Properties}} at Z=0, {{III}}},
  abstract = {We measure how the properties of star-forming central galaxies correlate with large-scale environment, \$$\backslash$delta\$, measured on \$10\$Mpc/h scales. We use group catalogs to isolate a robust sample of central galaxies with high purity and completeness. The properties we investigate are star formation rate (SFR), exponential disk scale length \$R\_\{$\backslash$rm exp\}\$, and Sersic index of the light profile, \$n\$. We find that, at all stellar masses, there is an inverse correlation between SFR and \$$\backslash$delta\$, meaning that above-average star forming centrals live in underdense regions. For \$n\$ and \$R\_\{$\backslash$rm exp\}\$, there is no correlation with \$$\backslash$delta\$ at \$M\_\{$\backslash$rm star\}$\backslash$lesssim 10\^\{10.5\}\$ \$M\_$\backslash$odot\$, but at higher masses there are positive correlations; a weak correlation with \$R\_\{$\backslash$rm exp\}\$ and a strong correlation with \$n\$. These data are evidence of assembly bias within the star-forming population. The results for SFR are consistent with a model in which SFR correlates with present-day halo accretion rate, \$$\backslash$dot\{M\}\_h\$. In this model, galaxies are assigned to halos using the abundance matching ansatz, which maps galaxy stellar mass onto halo mass. At fixed halo mass, SFR is assigned to galaxies using the same approach,but \$$\backslash$dot\{M\}\_h\$ is used to map onto SFR. The best-fit model requires some scatter in the \$$\backslash$dot\{M\}\_h\$-SFR relation. The \$R\_\{$\backslash$rm exp\}\$ and \$n\$ measurements are consistent with a model in which these quantities are correlated with the spin parameter of the halo, \$$\backslash$lambda\$. Halo spin does not correlate with \$$\backslash$delta\$ at low halo masses, but for higher mass halos, high-spin halos live in higher density environments at fixed \$M\_h\$. Put together with the earlier installments of this series, these data demonstrate that quenching processes have limited correlation with halo formation history, but the growth of active galaxies, as well as other detailed properties, are influenced by the details of halo assembly.},

  abstract = {Gladders et al. have recently suggested that the star formation histories (SFHs) of individual galaxies are characterized by a
log-normal function in time, implying a slow decline rather than rapid quenching. We test their conjecture on theoretical SFHs from the cosmological simulation Illustris and on observationally inferred SFHs. While the log-normal form necessarily ignores short-lived features such as starbursts, it fits the overall shape of the majority of SFHs very well. In particular, 85\% of the cumulative SFHs are fitted to within a maximum error of 5\% of the total stellar mass formed, and 99\% to within 10\%. The log-normal performs systematically better than the commonly used delayed-$\tau$ model, and is superseded only by functions with more than three free parameters. Poor fits are mostly found in galaxies that were rapidly quenched after becoming satellites. We explore the
log-normal parameter space of normalization, peak time, and full width at half maximum, and find that the simulated and observed samples occupy similar regions, though Illustris predicts wider, later-forming SFHs on average. The ensemble of log-normal fits correctly reproduces complex metrics such as the evolution of Illustris galaxies across the star formation main sequence, but overpredicts their quenching timescales. SFHs in Illustris are a diverse population not determined by any one physical property of galaxies, but follow a tight relation, where \{width\} $\backslash$propto \{(\{peak\}\{time\})\}3/2. We show that such a relation can be explained qualitatively (though not quantitatively) by a close connection between the growth of dark matter halos and their galaxies.},

  abstract = {The relation between galaxies and dark matter halos reflects the combined effects of many distinct physical processes. Observations indicate that the z = 0 stellar mass-halo mass (SMHM) relation has remarkably small scatter in stellar mass at fixed halo mass ($\lessequivlnt$0.2 dex), with little dependence on halo mass. We investigate the origins of this scatter by combining N-body simulations with observational
constraints on the SMHM relation. We find that at the group and cluster scale (\{M\}\{vir\}$\backslash$gt \{10\}14 \{M\}$\odot$ ) the scatter due purely to hierarchical assembly is $\approx$ 0.16 dex, which is comparable to recent direct observational estimates. At lower masses, mass buildup since z$\approx$ 2 is driven largely by in situ growth. We
include a model for the in situ buildup of stellar mass and find that an intrinsic scatter in this growth channel of 0.2 dex produces a relation between scatter and halo mass that is consistent with observations from \{10\}12 \{M\}$\odot$ $\backslash$lt \{M\}\{vir\}$\backslash$lt
\{10\}14.75 \{M\}$\odot$ . The approximately constant scatter across a wide range of halo masses at z = 0 thus appears to be a coincidence, as it is determined largely by in situ growth at low masses and by hierarchical assembly at high masses. These results indicate that the scatter in the SMHM relation can provide unique insight into the regularity of the galaxy formation process.},

Understanding of galaxy evolution rests on longitudinal interpretations of how these data relate to individual objects moving through time. The connection between the two is generally assumed to be clear, but we use a simple "physics-free" model to show that it is not and that exploring its nuances can lead to new insights. Comprising nothing more than \$$\backslash$sim2000\$ loosely constrained lognormal star formation histories, the model faithfully reproduces the following data it was never designed to match: stellar mass functions at \$z$\backslash$leq8\$; the slope of the star formation rate/stellar mass relation (the SF "Main Sequence") at \$z$\backslash$leq6\$; the mean \$\{$\backslash$rm sSFR\}($\backslash$equiv\{$\backslash$rm SFR\}/M\_*)\$ of low-mass galaxies at \$z$\backslash$leq7\$; "fast-" and "slow-track quenching"; galaxy downsizing; and a correlation between formation timescale and \$\{$\backslash$rm sSFR\}(M\_*,t)\$ similar to recent results from simulations that provides a natural connection to bulge growth. We take these surprising findings -- which ultimately imply that quenching is the "peeling-off" of the densest tail of the starforming population at any epoch -- to mean either that: (1) models in which galaxies are diversified on long timescales by something akin to initial conditions rival the dominant "grow-and-quench" framework as good descriptions of the data; or (2) cornerstone metrics of galaxy evolution are too information-poor -- if not intrinsically misleading -- to confirm a unique explanation. We outline future tests of our model but stress that, even if it is shown to be incorrect, it illustrates how exploring different evolutionary paradigms can aid learning and, we hope, more detailed modeling efforts.},

make the catalog public via a T-SQL database, which is described in
detail in this paper. We present the results using a range of stellar
population and dust models, and will continue to update the catalog as
new and improved models are made public. We also present a brief
exploration of the catalog, and show that the quantities derived are
robust: luminous red galaxies can be described by one to three
populations, whereas a main galaxy sample galaxy needs on average two to
five; red galaxies are older and less dusty; the dust values we recover
are well correlated with measured Balmer decrements and star formation
rates are also in agreement with previous measurements. We find that
whereas some derived quantities are robust to the choice of modelling,
many are still not.

  abstract = {Forward modeling of the full galaxy SED is a powerful technique, 
providing self-consistent constraints on stellar ages, dust properties,
and metallicities. However, the accuracy of these results is contingent
on the accuracy of the model. One significant source of uncertainty is
the contribution of obscured AGN, as they are relatively common and can
produce substantial mid-IR (MIR) emission. Here we include emission from
dusty AGN torii in the Prospector SED-fitting framework, and fit the
UV-IR broadband photometry of 129 nearby galaxies. We find that
10\% of the fitted galaxies host an AGN contributing $>$10\% of the
observed galaxy MIR luminosity. We demonstrate the necessity of this AGN
component in the following ways. First, we compare observed spectral
features to spectral features predicted from our model fit to the
photometry. We find that the AGN component greatly improves predictions
for observed H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ luminosities, as well as mid-infrared
Akari and Spitzer/IRS spectra. Second, we show that inclusion of the AGN
component changes stellar ages and SFRs by up to a factor of 10, and
dust attenuations by up to a factor of 2.5. Finally, we show that the
strength of our model AGN component correlates with independent AGN
indicators, suggesting that these galaxies truly host AGN. Notably, only
46\% of the SED-detected AGN would be detected with a simple MIR color
selection. Based on these results, we conclude that SED models which fit
MIR data without AGN components are vulnerable to substantial bias in
their derived parameters.},

challenge for models: many studies have shown that properties derived
from modeling galaxy photometry are uncertain by a factor of two or
more, and yet answering key questions in the field now requires higher
accuracy than this. Here, we present a new model framework specifically
designed for these complexities. Our model, Prospector- $\alpha$,
includes dust attenuation and re-radiation, a flexible attenuation
curve, nebular emission, stellar metallicity, and a six-component
nonparametric star formation history. The flexibility and range of the
parameter space, coupled with Monte Carlo Markov chain sampling within
the Prospector inference framework, is designed to provide unbiased
parameters and realistic error bars. We assess the accuracy of the model
with aperture-matched optical spectroscopy, which was excluded from the
fits. We compare spectral features predicted solely from fits to the
broadband photometry to the observed spectral features. Our model
predicts H$\alpha$ luminosities with a scatter of \texttildelow{}0.18 dex and an
offset of \texttildelow{}0.1 dex across a wide range of morphological types and
stellar masses. This agreement is remarkable, as the H$\alpha$ luminosity
is dependent on accurate star formation rates, dust attenuation, and
stellar metallicities. The model also accurately predicts dust-sensitive
Balmer decrements, spectroscopic stellar metallicities, polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbon mass fractions, and the age- and
metallicity-sensitive features Dn4000 and H$\delta$. Although
the model passes all these tests, we caution that we have not yet
assessed its performance at higher redshift or the accuracy of recovered
stellar masses.},

data-generating processes cannot be modeled by simple probability
distributions. With the ever-increasing size of data sets in cosmology,
there is an increasing burden placed on adequate modeling; systematic
errors in the model will dominate where previously these were swamped by
statistical errors. For example, Gaussian distributions are an
insufficient representation for errors in quantities like photometric
redshifts. Likewise, it can be difficult to quantify analytically the
distribution of errors that are introduced in complex fitting codes.
Without a simple form for these distributions, it becomes difficult to
accurately construct a likelihood function for the data as a function of
parameters of interest. Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) provides
a means of probing the posterior distribution when direct calculation of
a sufficiently accurate likelihood is intractable. ABC allows one to
bypass direct calculation of the likelihood but instead relies upon the
ability to simulate the forward process that generated the data. These
simulations can naturally incorporate priors placed on nuisance
parameters, and hence these can be marginalized in a natural way. We
present and discuss ABC methods in the context of supernova cosmology
using data from the SDSS-II Supernova Survey. Assuming a flat cosmology
and constant dark energy equation of state, we demonstrate that ABC can
recover an accurate posterior distribution. Finally, we show that ABC
can still produce an accurate posterior distribution when we contaminate

astronomical model analysis by application to a case study in the
morphological transformation of high-redshift galaxies. To this end, we
develop, first, a stochastic model for the competing processes of
merging and secular evolution in the early Universe, and secondly,
through an ABC-based comparison against the observed demographics of
massive (Mgal $>$ 1011 M$\odot$)

Extragalatic Legacy Survey (CANDELS)/Extended Groth Strip (EGS) data set
we derive posterior probability densities for the key parameters of this
model. The 'Sequential Monte Carlo' implementation of ABC exhibited
herein, featuring both a self-generating target sequence and
self-refining MCMC kernel, is amongst the most efficient of contemporary
approaches to this important statistical algorithm. We highlight as well
through our chosen case study the value of careful summary statistic
selection, and demonstrate two modern strategies for assessment and
optimization in this regard. Ultimately, our ABC analysis of the
high-redshift morphological mix returns tight constraints on the
evolving merger rate in the early Universe and favours major merging
(with disc survival or rapid reformation) over secular evolution as the
mechanism most responsible for building up the first generation of
bulges in early-type discs.},

imaging at 24 $\mu$m with the MIPS camera onboard \{Spitzer\} to determine the contribution of obscured light to the SFR of galaxies over the redshift range 0.8$\leq$ z $\leq$1.2. Accurate galaxy densities are measured thanks to the large sample of 1200 spectroscopic redshifts with high ( 70\%) spectroscopic completeness. Morphology and stellar masses are derived from deep HST-ACS imaging, supplemented by ground based imaging programs and photometry from the IRAC camera onboard \{Spitzer\}. Results: We show that the star formation-density relation observed locally was reversed at z\texttildelow{} 1: the average SFR of an individual
galaxy increased with local galaxy density when the universe was less than half its present age. Hierarchical galaxy formation models
(simulated lightcones from the Millennium model) predicted such a reversal to occur only at earlier epochs (z$>$2) and at a lower level. We present a remarkable structure at z\texttildelow{} 1.016, containing X-ray
traced galaxy concentrations, which will eventually merge into a Virgo-like cluster. This structure illustrates how the individual SFR of galaxies increases with density and shows that it is the 1-2 Mpc scale that affects most the star formation in galaxies at z\texttildelow{}1. The SFR of z\texttildelow{}1 galaxies is found to correlate with stellar mass suggesting that mass plays a role in the observed star formation-density trend. However the specific SFR (=SFR/Mstar) decreases with stellar mass while it increases with galaxy density, which implies that the environment does directly affect the star formation activity of
galaxies. Major mergers do not appear to be the unique or even major cause for this effect since nearly half (46\%) of the luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) at z\texttildelow{} 1 present the HST-ACS morphology of
spirals, while only a third present a clear signature of major mergers. The remaining galaxies are divided into compact (9\%) and irregular (14\%) galaxies. Moreover, the specific SFR of major mergers is only marginally stronger than that of spirals. Conclusions: These findings constrain the influence of the growth of large-scale structures on the star formation history of galaxies. Reproducing the SFR-density relation at z\texttildelow{}1 is a new challenge for models, requiring a correct balance between mass assembly through mergers and in-situ star formation at early epochs.},

semi-analytic galaxies. Recovered group properties are robust to the effects of interlopers and are median unbiased in the most important respects. G3Cv1 contains 14 388 galaxy groups (with

Additionally, despite exceptionally good local spatial completeness, G3Cv1 contains significantly fewer compact groups with five or more members, this effect becoming most evident for high multiplicity systems. These two differences are most likely due to limitations in the physics included of the current GAMA lightcone mock.

Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE) simulations. We find that the

H$\alpha$-derived SFR is considered compared with when the
far-ultraviolet (FUV)-based SFR is used. This difference is a direct
consequence of bursty star formation because the FIRE galaxies exhibit
order-of-magnitude SFR variations over time-scales of a few Myr. We show
that the difference in the scatter between the simulated H$\alpha$- and
FUV-derived SFR-M* relations at z = 2 is consistent with
observational constraints. We also find that the H$\alpha$/FUV ratios

numerical resolution chosen to marginally resolve the Jeans mass of the

The simulations have been shown to match a wide range of observations

been used to link galaxies across redshifts by creating merger trees.
The indexing of the tree produces a simple way to connect a galaxy at
one redshift to its progenitors at higher redshift and to identify its
descendants at lower redshift. In this paper we present a relational
database which we are making available for general use. A large number
of properties of haloes and galaxies and their merger trees are stored
in the database, including stellar masses, star formation rates,
metallicities, photometric measurements and mock gri images. Complex
queries can be created to explore the evolution of more than

  abstract = {Star-formation rates (SFR) of disk galaxies strongly correlate with stellar mass, with a small dispersion in SSFR at fixed mass, sigma\textasciitilde{}0.3 dex. With such small scatter this star-formation main sequence (SFMS) has been interpreted as deterministic and fundamental. Here we demonstrate that it is a simple consequence of the central limit theorem. Our derivation begins by approximating in situ stellar mass growth as a stochastic process, much like a random walk (where the expectation of SFR at any time is equal to the SFR at the previous time). We then derive expectation values for median SSFR of star-forming disks and their scatter over time. We generalize the results for stochastic changes in SFR that are not independent of each other but are correlated over time. For unbiased samples of (disk) galaxies, we derive an expectation that  should be independent of mass, decline as 1/T, and have a relative scatter that is independent of mass and time. The derived SFMS and its evolution matches published data to z=10 with sufficient accuracy to constrain cosmological parameters. The framework reproduces several important observables, including: the scatter in SSFR at fixed mass; the SFHs of nearby dwarf galaxies and the Milky Way; and the scatter in the Tully-Fisher relation. The evolution of the mass function is less well reproduced and we discuss ways to generalize the framework to include other sources of stellar mass such as mergers. The predicted dispersion in SSFR has consequences for the classification of quiescent galaxies, as such galaxies have heterogeneous formation histories, and many may only be temporarily diminished in their star-formation activity. The implied dispersion in SFHs, and the SFMS's insensitivity to timescales of stochasticity, thus substantially limits the ability to connect massive galaxies to their progenitors over long cosmic baselines.

feedback processes, the three models yield qualitatively similar
predictions for the assembly histories of galaxy stellar mass and star
formation over cosmic time. Comparing SAM predictions with existing
estimates of the stellar mass function from z = 0-8, we show that the
SAMs generally require strong outflows to suppress star formation in
low-mass halos to match the present-day stellar mass function, as is the
present common wisdom. However, all of the models considered produce
predictions for the star formation rates (SFRs) and metallicities of
low-mass galaxies that are inconsistent with existing data. The
predictions for metallicity-stellar mass relations and their evolution
clearly diverge between the models. We suggest that large differences in
the metallicity relations and small differences in the stellar mass
assembly histories of model galaxies stem from different assumptions for
the outflow mass-loading factor produced by feedback. Importantly, while
more accurate observational measurements for stellar mass, SFR and
metallicity of galaxies at 1 $<$ z $<$ 5 will discriminate between
models, the discrepancies between the constrained models and existing
data of these observables have already revealed challenging problems in
understanding star formation and its feedback in galaxy formation. The
three sets of models are being used to construct catalogs of mock
galaxies on light cones that have the same geometry as the CANDELS
survey, which should be particularly useful for quantifying the biases
and uncertainties on measurements and inferences from the real
observations.},

probe the correlations between halo formation histories. Over the
stellar mass range 109.7 $\leq$ M*/M$\odot$

further compare these data to predictions of the halo age-matching
model, in which the oldest galaxies are associated with the oldest
haloes. For models with strong correlations between halo and stellar
age, the conformity is too large to be consistent with the data. Weaker
implementations of the age-matching model would not produce a detectable
signal in SDSS data. We reproduce the results of Kauffmann et al., in
which the star formation rates of neighbour galaxies are reduced around
primary galaxies when the primaries are low star formers. However, we
find this result is mainly driven by contamination in the isolation
criterion; when removing the small fraction of satellite galaxies in the
sample, the conformity signal largely goes away. Lastly, we show that
small conformity signals, i.e. 2-5 per cent differences in the quenched
fractions of neighbour galaxies, can be produced by mechanisms other
than halo assembly bias. For example, if passive galaxies occupy more
massive haloes than star-forming galaxies of the same stellar mass, a
conformity signal that is consistent with recent measurements from
PRIMUS (Berti et al.) can be produced.},

The observational sample is volume limited out to z = 0.1 with Mr - 5 log (h) $\leq$ -19.6. We construct a mock catalogue of galaxies that shows a similar signal of assembly bias (46 $\pm$ 9 per cent) at the same halo mass. We then adapt the model
presented by Lacerna \& Padilla (Paper I) to redefine the overdensity peak height, which traces the assembly bias such that galaxies in equal density peaks show the same clustering regardless of their stellar age, but this time using observational features such as a flux limit. The proxy for peak height, which is proposed as a better alternative than the virial mass, consists in the total mass given by the mass of neighbour host haloes in cylinders centred at each central galaxy. The radius of the cylinder is parameterized as a function of stellar age and virial mass. The best-fitting sets of parameters that make the assembly bias signal lower than 5-15 per cent for both SDSS and mock central galaxies are similar. The idea behind the parameterization is not to minimize the bias, but it is to use this method to understand the physical features that produce the assembly bias effect. Even though the tracers of the density field used here differ significantly from those used in Paper I, our analysis of the simulated catalogue indicates that the different tracers produce correlated proxies, and therefore the reason behind assembly bias is the crowding of peaks in both simulations and the SDSS.},

In this paper, we analyse the influence of assembly bias on galaxy clustering using both semi-analytic galaxy formation models (SAMs) and observational data. At fixed stellar mass, SAMs predict that the clustering of central galaxies depends on the specific star formation rate (sSFR), with more passive galaxies having a higher clustering amplitude. We find similar trends using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) group catalogues, and verify that these are not affected by possible biases due to the group finding algorithm. Low-mass central galaxies reside in narrow bins of halo mass, so the observed trends of higher clustering amplitude for galaxies with lower sSFR is not driven by variations of the parent halo mass. We argue that the clustering dependence on sSFR represent a direct detection of assembly bias. In addition, contrary to what expected based on clustering of dark matter haloes, we find that low-mass central galaxies in SAMs with larger host halo mass have a lower clustering amplitude than their counter-parts residing in lower mass haloes. This results from the fact that, at fixed stellar mass, assembly bias has a stronger influence on clustering than the dependence on the parent halo mass.},

In agreement with previous studies, we find that more massive groups are more strongly clustered, and the inferred mass dependence of the halo bias is in good agreement with predictions for the $\Lambda$CDM concordance cosmology. Regarding the color dependence, we find that groups with red centrals are more strongly clustered than groups of the same mass but with blue centrals. Similar results are obtained when the color of a group is defined to be the total color of its member
galaxies. The color dependence is more prominent in less massive groups and becomes insignificant in groups with masses gtrsim1014 h-1 M$\odot$. These results are consistent with
those obtained by Yang et al. from an analysis of the 2dFGRS, but inconsistent with those obtained by Berlind et al., who also used an SDSS group catalog. We construct a mock galaxy redshift survey from the large Millennium N-body simulation. Applying our group finder to this mock survey, and analyzing the mock data in exactly the same way as the true data, we are able to accurately recover the intrinsic mass and color dependencies of the halo bias in the model. Interestingly, the semianalytical model reveals the same color dependence of the halo bias as we find in our group catalog.

clustering. We compare the original simulation to ‘shuffled' versions where the galaxy populations are randomly swapped among haloes of similar mass, thus isolating the effects of correlations between assembly history and environment at fixed mass. Such correlations are ignored in the halo occupation distribution models often used populate dark matter simulations with galaxies, but they are significant in our more realistic simulation. Assembly bias enhances two-point correlations by 10 per cent for galaxies with brighter than -17, but suppresses them by a similar amount for galaxies brighter than -20. When such samples are split by colour, assembly bias is 5 per cent stronger for red galaxies and 5 per cent weaker for blue ones. Halo central galaxies are differently affected by assembly bias than are galaxies of all types. It almost doubles the correlation amplitude for faint red central galaxies. Shuffling galaxies among haloes of fixed formation redshift or
concentration in addition to fixed mass produces biases which are not much smaller than when mass alone is fixed. Assembly bias must reflect a correlation of environment with aspects of halo assembly which are not encoded in either of these parameters. It induces effects which could compromise precision measurements of cosmological parameters from large galaxy surveys.},

Using the depth of the gravitational potential well, Vmax, as our secondary halo property, in this paper, we present the first study of the scale-dependence of assembly bias. In the large-scale linear regime, r $\geq$ 10 h-1 Mpc, our findings are in keeping with previous results. In particular, at the low-mass end
(coll $\approx$ 1012.5 M$\odot$
h-1), haloes with high Vmax show stronger
large-scale clustering relative to haloes with low Vmax of the same mass; this trend weakens and reverses for Mvir $\greaterequivlnt$ Mcoll. In the non-linear regime, assembly bias in
low-mass haloes exhibits a pronounced scale-dependent ‘bump' at 500 kpc h-1-5 Mpc h-1. This feature weakens and eventually vanishes for haloes of higher mass. We show that this scale-dependent signature can primarily be attributed to a special subpopulation of ejected haloes, defined as present-day host haloes that were previously members of a higher mass halo at some point in their past history. A corollary of our results is that galaxy clustering on scales of r \texttildelow{} 1-2 Mpc h-1 can be impacted by up to \texttildelow{}15 per

dependence on halo mass. While some formation times characterize well the hierarchical nature of halo formation, in the sense that more massive haloes have later formation, the trend is reversed for other definitions of the formation time. In particular, the formation times that are likely to be related to the formation of galaxies in dark haloes show strong trends of ‘downsizing', in that lower mass haloes form later. We also investigate how the correlation amplitude of dark matter haloes depends on the different formation times. We find that this dependence is quite strong for some definitions of formation time but weak or absent for other definitions. In particular, the correlation amplitude of haloes of a given mass is almost independent of their last major merger time. For the definitions that are expected to be more related to the formation of galaxies in dark haloes, a significant assembly bias is found only for haloes less massive than M*.

These improvements lead to results with less noise than previous studies and covering a wider range of halo masses and structural properties.

For the first time, we show unequivocally that halo clustering is a
function of halo concentration and show that the dependence of halo bias
on concentration, mass, and redshift can be accurately parameterized in
a simple way:
b(M,c|z)=b(M|z)bcvir(c|M/M*).
Interestingly, the scaling between bias and concentration changes sign
with the value of M/M*: high-concentration (early forming)
objects cluster more strongly for M$<$\textasciitilde{}M*, while
low-concentration (late forming) objects cluster more strongly for rare
high-mass halos, M$>$\textasciitilde{}M*. We show the first explicit
demonstration that host dark halo clustering depends on the halo
occupation number (of dark matter subhalos) at fixed mass and discuss
implications for halo model calculations of dark matter power spectra
and galaxy clustering statistics. The effect of these halo properties on
clustering is strongest for early-forming dwarf-mass halos, which are
significantly more clustered than typical halos of their mass. Our
results suggest that isolated low-mass galaxies (e.g., low surface
brightness dwarfs) should have more slowly rising rotation curves than
their more clustered counterparts and may have consequences for the
dearth of dwarf galaxies in voids. They also imply that self-calibrating
richness-selected cluster samples with their clustering properties might
overestimate cluster masses and bias cosmological parameter estimation.},

the comparison between theory and observation, and to remove the strong
environmental effects on satellites, we use galaxy group catalogues to
identify central galaxies and measure their quenched fraction,
fQ, as a function of large-scale environment. Models that
match halo age to central galaxy age predict a strong positive
correlation between fQ and $\rho$. However, we show that the
amplitude of this effect depends on the definition of halo age: assembly
bias is significantly reduced when removing the effects of splashback
haloes - those haloes that are central but have passed through a larger
halo or experienced strong tidal encounters. Defining age using halo
mass at its peak value rather than current mass removes these effects.

agreement with predictions of dark matter haloes using peak halo mass.
At lower stellar mass there is little to no correlation of fQ
with $\rho$. For these galaxies, age matching is inconsistent with the
data across the range of halo formation metrics that we tested. This
implies that halo formation history has a small but statistically
significant impact on quenching of star formation at high masses, while
the quenching process in low-mass central galaxies is uncorrelated with
halo formation history.},

characterized by the halo mass of the central galaxy and the fraction of
galaxies that are satellites. Here, we present observational constraints
from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey on these quantities as a function of
r-band luminosity and stellar mass using galaxy-galaxy weak lensing,
with a total of 351507 lenses. We use stellar masses derived from
spectroscopy and virial halo masses derived from weak gravitational
lensing to determine the efficiency with which baryons in the halo of
the central galaxy have been converted into stars. We find that an
L* galaxy with a stellar mass of 6 \texttimes{}
1010Msolar is hosted by a halo with mass of 1.4
\texttimes{} 1012h-1Msolar, independent of
morphology, yielding baryon conversion efficiencies of
17+10-5 per cent (early-types) and
16+15-6 per cent (late-types) at the 95 per cent
confidence level (statistical, not including systematic uncertainty due
to assumption of a universal initial mass function). We find that for a
given stellar mass, the halo mass is independent of morphology below
Mstellar = 1011Msolar, in contrast to
typically a factor of 2 difference in halo mass between ellipticals and
spirals at a fixed luminosity. This suggests that stellar mass is a good
proxy for halo mass in this range and should be used preferentially
whenever a halo mass selected sample is needed. For higher stellar
masses, the conversion efficiency is a declining function of stellar
mass, and the differences in halo mass between early- and late-types
become larger, reflecting the fact that most group and cluster haloes
with masses above 1013Msolar host ellipticals at
the centre, while even the brightest central spirals are hosted by
haloes of mass below 1013Msolar. We find that the
fraction of spirals that are satellites is roughly 10-15 per cent
independent of stellar mass or luminosity, while for ellipticals this
fraction decreases with stellar mass from 50 per cent at
1010Msolar to 10 per cent at 3 \texttimes{}
1011Msolar or 20 per cent at the maximum
luminosity considered. We split the elliptical sample by local density,
and find that at a given luminosity there is no difference in the signal
on scales below 100h-1kpc between high- and low-density
regions, suggesting that tidal stripping inside large haloes does not
remove most of the DM from the early-type satellites. This result is
dominated by haloes in the mass range
1013-1014h-1Msolar, and is
an average over all separations from the group or cluster centre.},

luminosity and stellar mass. Our investigation uses 154 deg2
of Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS) lensing and
photometric data, obtained from the CFHT Legacy Survey. To interpret the
weak lensing signal around our galaxies, we employ a galaxy-galaxy
lensing halo model which allows us to constrain the halo mass and the
satellite fraction. Our analysis is limited to lenses at redshifts
between 0.2 and 0.4, split into a red and a blue sample. We express the
relationship between dark matter halo mass and baryonic observable as a
power law with pivot points of 10\^\{11\} h\_\{70\}\^\{-2\} L\_\{\{$\odot$\}\} and
2\texttimes{} 10\^\{11\} h\_\{70\}\^\{-2\} M\_\{\{$\odot$\}\} for luminosity and stellar
mass, respectively. For the luminosity-halo mass relation, we find a
slope of 1.32 $\pm$ 0.06 and a normalization of
1.19\^\{+0.06\}\_\{-0.07\}\texttimes{} 10\^\{13\} h\_\{70\}\^\{-1\} M\_\{\{$\odot$\}\} for red
galaxies, while for blue galaxies the best-fitting slope is

0.18\^\{+0.04\}\_\{-0.05\}\texttimes{} 10\^\{13\} h\_\{70\}\^\{-1\} M\_\{\{$\odot$\}\}. Similarly,
we find a best-fitting slope of 1.36\^\{+0.06\}\_\{-0.07\} and a normalization
of 1.43\^\{+0.11\}\_\{-0.08\}\texttimes{} 10\^\{13\} h\_\{70\}\^\{-1\} M\_\{\{$\odot$\}\} for the
stellar mass-halo mass relation of red galaxies, while for blue galaxies

0.84\^\{+0.20\}\_\{-0.16\}\texttimes{} 10\^\{13\} h\_\{70\}\^\{-1\} M\_\{\{$\odot$ \}\}. All
numbers convey the 68 per cent confidence limit. For red lenses, the
fraction which are satellites inside a larger halo tends to decrease
with luminosity and stellar mass, with the sample being nearly all
satellites for a stellar mass of 2\texttimes{} 109 h\_\{70\}\^\{-2\}
M\_\{\{$\odot$\}\}. The satellite fractions are generally close to zero for
blue lenses, irrespective of luminosity or stellar mass. This, together
with the shallower relation between halo mass and baryonic tracer, is a
direct confirmation from galaxy-galaxy lensing that blue galaxies reside
in less clustered environments than red galaxies. We also find that the
halo model, while matching the lensing signal around red lenses well, is
prone to overpredicting the large-scale signal for faint and less
massive blue lenses. This could be a further indication that these
galaxies tend to be more isolated than assumed.},

scaling of halo mass, Mh, with various group observables is
investigated. Our main results are as follows. (1) The measured
relations of halo mass with group luminosity, virial volume and central
galaxy stellar mass, M*, agree very well with predictions
from mock group catalogues constructed from a GALFORM semi-analytical
galaxy formation model implemented in the Millennium $\Lambda$CDM N-body
simulation. (2) The measured relations of halo mass with velocity
dispersion and projected half-abundance radius show weak tension with
mock predictions, hinting at problems in the mock galaxy dynamics and
their small-scale distribution. (3) The median
Mh|M* measured from weak lensing depends more
sensitively on the lognormal dispersion in M* at fixed
Mh than it does on the median M*|Mh.
Our measurements suggest an intrinsic dispersion of
$\sigma$log(M*)\texttildelow{} 0.15. (4) Comparing our mass
estimates with those in the catalogue, we find that the G3Cv5
mass can give biased results when used to select subsets of the group
sample. Of the various new halo-mass estimators that we calibrate using
our weak-lensing measurements, group luminosity is the best single-proxy
estimator of group mass.},

find, for the first time from weak lensing alone, evidence for
significant evolution in the SHMR: the peak ratio falls as a function of cosmic time from 4.5 $\pm$ 0.3 per cent at z \texttildelow{} 0.7 to 3.4
$\pm$ 0.2 per cent at z \texttildelow{} 0.3, and shifts to lower stellar mass
haloes. These evolutionary trends are dominated by red galaxies, and are consistent with a model in which the stellar mass above which star formation is quenched ‘downsizes' with cosmic time. In contrast, the SHMR of blue, star-forming galaxies is well fitted by a power law that does not evolve with time. This suggests that blue galaxies form stars at a rate that is balanced with their dark matter accretion in such a way that they evolve along the SHMR locus. The redshift dependence of the SHMR can be used to constrain the evolution of the galaxy population over cosmic time.},

mass and the underlying dark matter haloes provides the crucial link
from theories of large-scale structure formation to interpreting the
complex phenomena of galaxy formation and evolution. We develop a novel
statistical method, based on the halo occupation distribution (HOD)
model, to solve for this mapping by jointly fitting the galaxy
clustering and the galaxy-galaxy lensing from the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey (SDSS). The method, called the
iHOD model, extracts maximum
information from the survey by including \texttildelow{}80 per cent more
galaxies than the traditional HOD methods, accounting for the
incompleteness of the stellar mass samples self-consistently. The
derived stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) explains the clustering and
lensing of SDSS galaxies over four decades in stellar mass, while
successfully predicting the observed stellar mass functions (SMFs). By
modelling significantly more galaxies, the
iHOD breaks the degeneracy between
the logarithmic scatter in the stellar mass at fixed halo mass and the
slope of the mean SHMR at high masses, without assuming a strong prior
on the scatter and/or using the SMF as an input. We detect a decline of
the scatter with halo mass, from 0.22\_\{-0.01\}\^\{+0.02\} dex below
1012 h-1 M$\odot$ to 0.18 $\pm$ 0.01
dex at 1014 h-1 M$\odot$. The model
predicts a departure of satellite SMFs from the Schechter form in
massive haloes and a linear scaling of satellite number with halo mass.
The iHOD model can be easily applied
to other spectroscopic data sets, greatly improving statistical
constraints on the SHMR compared to traditional HOD methods within the

galaxies from their IR emission using the 24 $\mu$m band of MIPS-Spitzer. Methods: We used an updated version of the GOODS-MUSIC catalog, which has multiwavelength coverage from 0.3 to 24 $\mu$m and either
spectroscopic or accurate photometric redshifts. We describe how the catalog has been extended by the addition of mid-IR fluxes derived from the MIPS 24 $\mu$m image. We compared two different estimators of the star formation rate (SFR hereafter). One is the total infrared emission derived from 24 $\mu$m, estimated using both synthetic and empirical IR templates. The other one is a multiwavelength fit to the full galaxy SED, which automatically accounts for dust reddening and age-star formation activity degeneracies. For both estimates, we computed the SFR density and the specific SFR. Results: We show that the two SFR indicators are roughly consistent, once the uncertainties involved are taken into account. However, they show a systematic trend, IR-based estimates exceeding the fit-based ones as the star formation rate increases. With this new catalog, we show that: a) at z$>$0.3, the star formation rate is correlated well with stellar mass, and this
relationship seems to steepen with redshift if one relies on IR-based estimates of the SFR; b) the contribution to the global SFRD by massive galaxies increases with redshift up to $\simeq$ 2.5, more rapidly than for galaxies of lower mass, but appears to flatten at higher z; c) despite this increase, the most important contributors to the SFRD at any z are galaxies of about, or immediately lower than, the characteristic stellar mass; d) at z$\simeq$ 2, massive galaxies are actively star-forming, with a median \{SFR\} $\simeq$ 300 M\_$\odot$ yr-1. During this epoch,
our targeted galaxies assemble a substantial part of their final stellar mass; e) the specific SFR (SSFR) shows a clear bimodal distribution. Conclusions: The analysis of the SFR density and the SSFR seems to support the downsizing scenario, according to which high mass galaxies have formed their stars earlier and more rapidly than their low mass counterparts. A comparison with renditions of theoretical simulations of galaxy formation and evolution indicates that these models follow the global increase in the SSFR with redshift and predict the existence of quiescent galaxies even at z$>$1.5. However, the average SSFR is
systematically underpredicted by all models considered.

the evolution of the star-forming galaxy (SFG) main sequence (MS) in
stellar mass and star formation rate (SFR) out to z \textasciitilde{} 6. After
converting all observations to a common set of calibrations, we find a
remarkable consensus among MS observations (\textasciitilde{}0.1 dex 1$\sigma$
interpublication scatter). By fitting for time evolution of the MS in
bins of constant mass, we deconvolve the observed scatter about the MS
within each observed redshift bin. After accounting for observed scatter
between different SFR indicators, we find the width of the MS
distribution is \textasciitilde{}0.2 dex and remains constant over cosmic time. Our best
fits indicate the slope of the MS is likely time-dependent, with our
best-fit log SFR(M *, t) = (0.84 $\pm$ 0.02 - 0.026
$\pm$ 0.003 \texttimes{} t)log M * - (6.51 $\pm$ 0.24
- 0.11 $\pm$ 0.03 \texttimes{} t), where t is the age of the
universe in Gyr. We use our fits to create empirical evolutionary tracks
in order to constrain MS galaxy star formation histories (SFHs), finding
that (1) the most accurate representations of MS SFHs are given by
delayed-$\tau$ models, (2) the decline in fractional stellar mass growth
for a "typical" MS galaxy today is approximately linear for most of its
lifetime, and (3) scatter about the MS can be generated by galaxies
evolving along identical evolutionary tracks assuming an initial
1$\sigma$ spread in formation times of \textasciitilde{}1.4 Gyr.},

  abstract = {The galaxy stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) is nearly 
time-independent for z $<$ 4. We therefore construct a time-independent SHMR model for central galaxies, wherein the in situ star formation rate (SFR) is determined by the halo mass accretion rate (MAR), which we call stellar halo accretion rate coevolution (SHARC). We show that the \texttildelow{}0.3 dex dispersion of the halo MAR matches the observed
dispersion of the SFR on the star formation main sequence (MS). In the context of ‘bathtub'-type models of galaxy formation, SHARC leads to mass-dependent constraints on the relation between SFR and MAR. Despite its simplicity and the simplified treatment of mass growth from mergers, the SHARC model is likely to be a good approximation for central galaxies with M* = 109-1010.5
M$\odot$ that are on the MS, representing most of the star
formation in the Universe. SHARC predictions agree with observed SFRs for galaxies on the MS at low redshifts, agree fairly well at z \texttildelow{} 4, but exceed observations at z $\greaterequivlnt$ 4. Assuming that the interstellar gas mass is constant for each galaxy (the ‘equilibrium condition' in bathtub models), the SHARC model allows calculation of net mass loading factors for inflowing and outflowing gas. With assumptions about preventive feedback based on simulations, SHARC allows calculation of galaxy metallicity evolution. If galaxy SFRs indeed track halo MARs, especially at low redshifts, that may help explain the success of models linking galaxy properties to haloes (including age-matching) and the similarities between two-halo galaxy conformity and halo mass accretion conformity.},

high density environments based on fixed cylindrical aperture
environment measurements on a volume-limited environment defining
population. For quiescent and SF galaxies in low or high density
environments, we examine the evolution of their stellar mass function
(SMF). Then using the SMFs we compute
\{\{f\}Q\}(\{\{M\}*\}) and quantify its evolution within
our redshift range. We find that the quiescent fraction is higher at
higher masses and in denser environments. The quiescent fraction rises
with cosmic time for all masses and environments. At a fiducial mass of

the quiescent fraction rises by 15\% at the lowest environments and by
25\% at the highest environments we measure. These results suggest that
for a minority of galaxies their cessation of star formation is due to
external influences on them. In other words, in the recent universe a
substantial fraction of the galaxies that cease forming stars do so due

We compare the SMFs for quiescent and star-forming galaxies in the highest and lowest environments using a density estimator based on the distance to the galaxies' third-nearest neighbors. For star-forming galaxies, at all redshifts there are only minor differences with environment in the shape of the SMF. For quiescent galaxies, the SMF in the lowest densities shows no evolution with redshift, other than an overall increase in number density (phi*) with time. This suggests that the stellar-mass dependence of quenching in relatively isolated galaxies is both universal and does not evolve strongly. While at z $>$\textasciitilde{} 1.5 the SMF of quiescent galaxies is indistinguishable in the highest and lowest densities, at lower redshifts it shows a rapidly increasing number density of lower-mass galaxies, log M / Msun \textasciitilde{}= 9-10. We argue this evolution can account for all the redshift evolution in the shape of the total quiescent-galaxy SMF. This evolution in the quiescent-galaxy SMF at higher redshift (z $>$ 1) requires an environmental-quenching efficiency that decreases with decreasing stellar mass at 0.5 $<$ z $<$ 1.5 or it would overproduce the number of lower-mass quiescent galaxies in denser environments. This requires a dominant environment process such as starvation combined with rapid gas depletion and ejection at z $>$ 0.5 - 1.0 for galaxies in our mass range. The efficiency of this process decreases with redshift allowing other processes (such as galaxy interactions and ram-pressure stripping) to become more important at later times, z $<$ 0.5.},

from z = 4.0 to z = 1.3 measured from a sample constructed from the deep
near-infrared Multi-wavelength Survey by Yale-Chile, the Faint Infrared
Extragalactic Survey, and the Great Observatories Origins Deep
Survey-Chandra Deep Field South surveys, all having very high-quality
optical to mid-infrared data. This sample, unique in that it combines
data from surveys with a large range of depths and areas in a
self-consistent way, allowed us to (1) minimize the uncertainty due to
cosmic variance and empirically quantify its contribution to the total
error budget; (2) simultaneously probe the high-mass end and the
low-mass end (down to \textasciitilde{}0.05 times the characteristic stellar mass) of
the SMF with good statistics; and (3) empirically derive the
redshift-dependent completeness limits in stellar mass. We provide, for
the first time, a comprehensive analysis of random and systematic
uncertainties affecting the derived SMFs, including the effect of
metallicity, extinction law, stellar population synthesis model, and
initial mass function. We find that the mass density evolves by a factor
of \textasciitilde{}17+7 -10 since z = 4.0, mostly driven by a
change in the normalization $\Phi$sstarf. If only random
errors are taken into account, we find evidence for mass-dependent
evolution, with the low-mass end evolving more rapidly than the
high-mass end. However, we show that this result is no longer robust
when systematic uncertainties due to the SED-modeling assumptions are
taken into account. Another significant uncertainty is the contribution
to the overall stellar mass density of galaxies below our mass limit;
future studies with WFC3 will provide better constraints on the SMF at
masses below 1010 M sun at z$>$2. Taking our
results at face value, we find that they are in conflict with
semianalytic models of galaxy formation. The models predict SMFs that
are in general too steep, with too many low-mass galaxies and too few
high-mass galaxies. The discrepancy at the high-mass end is susceptible
to uncertainties in the models and the data, but the discrepancy at the
low-mass end may be more difficult to explain.

  title = {Massive Optimal Data Compression and Density Estimation for Scalable, Likelihood-Free Inference in Cosmology},
  abstract = {Many statistical models in cosmology can be simulated forwards but have intractable likelihood functions. Likelihood-free inference methods allow us to perform Bayesian inference from these models using only forward simulations, free from any likelihood assumptions or approximations. Likelihood-free inference generically involves simulating mock data and comparing to the observed data; this comparison in data-space suffers from the curse of dimensionality and requires compression of the data to a small number of summary statistics to be tractable. In this paper we use massive optimal data compression to reduce the dimensionality of the data-space to just one number per parameter, providing a natural and optimal framework for summary statistic choice for likelihood-free inference. Secondly, we introduce density estimation likelihood-free inference, which learns a parameterized model for joint distribution of data and parameters, yielding both the parameter posterior and the model evidence. This approach is conceptually simple, requires less tuning than traditional Approximate Bayesian Computation approaches to likelihood-free inference and can give high-fidelity posteriors from orders of magnitude fewer forward simulations. As an additional bonus, it enables parameter inference and Bayesian model comparison simultaneously. We demonstrate density estimation likelihood-free inference with massive data compression on an analysis of the joint light-curve analysis supernova data. We show that high-fidelity posterior inference is possible for full-scale cosmological data analyses with as few as \$$\backslash$sim 10\^4\$ simulations, with substantial scope for further improvement, demonstrating the scalability of likelihood-free inference to large and complex cosmological datasets.},

  abstract = {Parametric models for galaxy star-formation histories (SFHs) are widely used, though they are known to impose strong priors on physical parameters. This has consequences for measurements of the galaxy stellar-mass function (GSMF), star-formation-rate density (SFRD) and star-forming main sequence (SFMS). We investigate the effects of the exponentially declining, delayed exponentially declining, lognormal and double power law SFH models using BAGPIPES. We demonstrate that each of these models imposes strong priors on specific star-formation rates (sSFRs), potentially biasing the SFMS, and also imposes a strong prior preference for young stellar populations. We show that stellar mass, SFR and mass-weighted age inferences from high-quality mock photometry vary with the choice of SFH model by at least 0.1, 0.3 and 0.2 dex respectively. However the biases with respect to the true values depend more on the true SFH shape than the choice of model. We also demonstrate that photometric data cannot discriminate between SFH models, meaning it is important to perform independent tests to find well-motivated priors. We finally fit a low-redshift, volume-complete sample of galaxies from the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) Survey with each model. We demonstrate that our stellar masses and SFRs at redshift, \$z$\backslash$sim0.05\$ are consistent with other analyses. However, our inferred cosmic SFRDs peak at \$z$\backslash$sim0.4\$, approximately 6 Gyr later than direct observations suggest, meaning our mass-weighted ages are significantly underestimated. This makes the use of parametric SFH models for understanding mass assembly in galaxies challenging. In a companion paper we consider non-parametric SFH models.},

  abstract = {Nonparametric star formation histories (SFHs) have long promised to be the "gold standard" for galaxy SED modeling as they are flexible enough to describe the full diversity of SFH shapes, whereas parametric models rule out a significant fraction of these shapes \{$\backslash$it a priori\}. However, this flexibility isn't fully constrained even with high-quality observations, making it critical to choose a well-motivated prior. Here we use the SED-fitting code Prospector to explore the effect of different nonparametric priors by fitting SFHs to mock UV-IR photometry generated from a diverse set of input SFHs. First, we confirm that nonparametric SFHs recover input SFHs with less bias and return more accurate errors than parametric SFHs. We further find that while nonparametric SFHs robustly recover the overall shape of the input SFH, the primary determinant of the size and shape of the posterior SFR(t) is the choice of prior rather than the photometric noise. As a practical demonstration, we fit the UV-IR photometry of \$$\backslash$sim\$6000 galaxies from the GAMA survey and measure inter-prior scatters in mass (0.1 dex), SFR\$\_\{100$\backslash$; $\backslash$mathrm\{Myr\}\}\$ (0.8 dex), and mass-weighted ages (0.2 dex), with the bluest star-forming galaxies showing the most sensitivity. An important distinguishing characteristic for nonparametric models is the characteristic timescale for changes in SFR(t). This difference controls whether galaxies are assembled in bursts or in steady-state star formation, corresponding respectively to (feedback-dominated/accretion-dominated) models of galaxy formation and to (larger/smaller) confidence intervals derived from SED-fitting. High quality spectroscopy has the potential to further distinguish between these proposed models of SFR(t).},

Additionally, our results suggest that satellite galaxies have a radial profile less centrally concentrated than dark matter but not as cored as resolved subhaloes in dark matter-only simulations. Compared to previous works using satellite kinematics by More et al., we find much more competitive constraints on the galaxy-halo connection, on par with those derived from a combination of galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing. We compare our results on the galaxy-halo connection to other studies using galaxy clustering and group catalogues, showing very good agreement between these different techniques.
