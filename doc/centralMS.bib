  abstract = {We examine the dependence of the mass-to-light (M/L) ratio of large-scale structure on cosmological parameters, in models that are constrained to match observations of the projected galaxy correlation function wp(rp) and the galaxy luminosity
function. For a sequence of cosmological models with a fixed,
observationally motivated power spectrum shape and increasing
normalization $\sigma$8, we find parameters of the galaxy halo occupation distribution (HOD) that reproduce
wp(rp) measurements as a function of luminosity from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). From these HOD models we calculate the r-band conditional luminosity function
$\Phi$(L|Mh), and from this the mean M/L ratio as a function of halo mass Mh. We also use $\Phi$(L|Mh) to
populate halos of N-body simulations with galaxies and thereby compute M/L in a range of large-scale environments, including cluster infall regions. For all cosmological models, the M/L ratio in high-mass halos or high-density regions is approximately independent of halo mass or smoothing scale. However, the ‘‘plateau'' value of M/L depends on $\sigma$8 in addition to the obvious proportionality with the matter density parameter $\Omega$m, and it represents the
universal value
=$\Omega$m$\rho$crit/$\rho$lum
only for models in which the galaxy correlation function is
approximately unbiased, i.e., with
$\sigma$8\textasciitilde$\sigma$8g. Our results for cluster mass
halos follow the trend
(M/L)cl=577($\Omega$m/0.3)($\sigma$8/0.9)1.7 h Msolar/Lsolar. Combined with the mean M/L ratio for CNOC galaxy clusters, this relation implies
($\sigma$8/0.9)($\Omega$m/0.3)0.6=0.75+/-0.06. M/L estimates for SDSS clusters and the virial regions of clusters in the CAIRNS survey imply a similar value of
$\sigma$8$\Omega$0.6m, while the CAIRNS
estimates for cluster infall regions imply a lower value. These results are inconsistent with parameter values $\Omega$m\textasciitilde{}0.3,
$\sigma$8\textasciitilde{}0.9 favored by recent joint analyses of cosmic
microwave background measurements and other large-scale structure data, although they agree with values inferred from the van den Bosch et al. analysis of the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey. We discuss possible
resolutions of this discrepancy, none of which seems entirely
satisfactory. In appendices we present an improved formula for halo bias factors calibrated on our 3603 N-body simulations and an improved analytic technique for calculating the galaxy correlation function from a given cosmological model and HOD.},

  abstract = {We place constraints on the average density ($\Omega$ m ) and 
clustering amplitude ($\sigma$8) of matter using a combination
of two measurements from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey: the galaxy
two-point correlation function, wp (rp ), and the
mass-to-galaxy-number ratio within galaxy clusters, M/N, analogous to
cluster M/L ratios. Our wp (rp ) measurements are
obtained from DR7 while the sample of clusters is the maxBCG sample,
with cluster masses derived from weak gravitational lensing. We
construct nonlinear galaxy bias models using the Halo Occupation
Distribution (HOD) to fit both wp (rp ) and M/N
for different cosmological parameters. HOD models that match the same
two-point clustering predict different numbers of galaxies in massive
halos when $\Omega$ m or $\sigma$8 is varied,
thereby breaking the degeneracy between cosmology and bias. We
demonstrate that this technique yields constraints that are consistent
and competitive with current results from cluster abundance studies,
without the use of abundance information. Using wp
(rp ) and M/N alone, we find $\Omega$0.5 m
$\sigma$8 = 0.465 $\pm$ 0.026, with individual
constraints of $\Omega$ m = 0.29 $\pm$ 0.03 and
$\sigma$8 = 0.85 $\pm$ 0.06. Combined with current cosmic
microwave background data, these constraints are $\Omega$ m =
0.290 $\pm$ 0.016 and $\sigma$8 = 0.826 $\pm$ 0.020. All
errors are 1$\sigma$. The systematic uncertainties that the M/N technique
are most sensitive to are the amplitude of the bias function of dark
matter halos and the possibility of redshift evolution between the SDSS
Main sample and the maxBCG cluster sample. Our derived constraints are
insensitive to the current level of uncertainties in the halo mass
function and in the mass-richness relation of clusters and its scatter,
making the M/N technique complementary to cluster abundances as a method
for constraining cosmology with future galaxy surveys.},

  abstract = {We present the first scientific results from the luminous red galaxy sample (LRG) of the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS). We measure the small and intermediate scale clustering from a sample of more than 61,000 galaxies in the redshift range \$0.6 $<$ z $<$ 0.9\$. We interpret these measurements in the framework of the Halo Occupation Distribution. The bias of eBOSS LRGs is \$2.30 $\backslash$pm 0.03\$, with a satellite fraction of \$13$\backslash$pm3\$$\backslash$\% and a mean halo mass of \$2.5$\backslash$times10\^\{13\}h\^\{-1\}M\_\{$\backslash$odot\}\$. These results are consistent with expectations, demonstrating that eBOSS galaxies will be reliable tracers of large scale structure at \$z$\backslash$sim 0.7\$. The eBOSS galaxy bias implies a scatter of luminosity at fixed halo mass, \$$\backslash$sigma\_\{$\backslash$log L\}\$, of 0.19 dex. Using the clustering of massive galaxies from BOSS-CMASS, BOSS-LOWZ, and SDSS, we find that \$$\backslash$sigma\_\{$\backslash$log L\}=0.19\$ is consistent with observations over the full redshift range that these samples cover.

  abstract = {Using some of the latest cosmological datasets publicly available, we derive the strongest bounds in the literature on the sum of the three active neutrino masses, \$M\_$\backslash$nu\$. In the most conservative scheme, combining Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature anisotropies and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) data, as well as the up-to-date constraint on the optical depth to reionization (\$$\backslash$tau\$), the tightest \$95$\backslash$\%\$ confidence level (C.L.) upper bound we find is \$M\_$\backslash$nu$<$0.151\$\textasciitilde{}eV. The addition of Planck high-\$$\backslash$ell\$ polarization tightens the bound to \$M\_$\backslash$nu$<$0.118\$\textasciitilde{}eV. Further improvements are possible when a less conservative prior on the Hubble parameter is added, bringing down the \$95$\backslash$\%\$\textasciitilde{}C.L. upper limit to \$$\backslash$sim 0.09\$\textasciitilde{}eV. The three aforementioned combinations exclude values of \$M\_$\backslash$nu\$ larger than the minimal value allowed in the inverted hierarchical (IH) mass ordering, \$0.0986\$\textasciitilde{}eV, at \$$\backslash$sim 82$\backslash$\%\$\textasciitilde{}C.L., \$$\backslash$sim 91$\backslash$\%\$\textasciitilde{}C.L., and \$$\backslash$sim 96$\backslash$\%\$\textasciitilde{}C.L. respectively.

We test the stability of the bounds against the distribution of the total mass \$M\_$\backslash$nu\$ among the three mass eigenstates, finding that these are relatively stable against the choice of distributing the total mass among three (the usual approximation) or one mass eigenstate. Finally, we compare the constraining power of measurements of the full-shape galaxy power spectrum versus the BAO signature, from the BOSS survey. Even though the latest BOSS full shape measurements cover a larger volume and benefit from smaller error bars compared to previous similar measurements, the analysis method commonly adopted results in their constraining power still being less powerful than that of the extracted BAO signal.

The decorated HOD is a model for the galaxy-halo connection that augments the HOD by allowing for the possibility of galaxy assembly bias: galaxy luminosity may be correlated with dark matter halo properties besides mass, Mvir. We demonstrate that it is not possible to rule out galaxy assembly bias using DR7 measurements of galaxy clustering alone. Moreover, galaxy samples with Mr $<$ -20 and Mr $<$ -20.5 favor strong central galaxy assembly bias. These samples prefer scenarios in which high-concentration are more likely to host a central galaxy relative to low-concentration halos of the same mass. We exclude zero assembly bias with high significance for these samples. Satellite galaxy assembly bias is significant for the faintest sample, Mr $<$ -19. We find no evidence for assembly bias in the Mr $<$ -21 sample. Assembly bias should be accounted for in galaxy clustering analyses or attempts to exploit galaxy clustering to constrain cosmology. In addition to presenting the first constraints on HOD models that accommodate assembly bias, our analysis includes several improvements over previous analyses of these data. Therefore, our inferences supersede previously-published results even in the case of a standard HOD analysis.},

bias removed. We fit HODs to the galaxy clustering in each catalogue. In
the absence of assembly bias, the inferred HODs describe the true HODs
well, validating the methodology. However, in all cases with assembly
bias, the inferred HODs exhibit significant systematic errors. We
conclude that the galaxy-halo relationship inferred from galaxy

assembly bias. Efforts to model and/or constrain assembly bias should be

surveys offer an attractive method for measuring the build-up of
cosmological structure, which depends both on the expansion rate of the
Universe and on our theory of gravity. The statistical precision with
which redshift-space distortions can now be measured demands better
control of our theoretical systematic errors. While many recent studies
focus on understanding dark matter clustering in redshift space,
galaxies occupy special places in the universe: dark matter haloes. In
our detailed study of halo clustering and velocity statistics in 67.5
h-3 Gpc3 of N-body simulations, we uncover a
complex dependence of redshift-space clustering on halo bias. We
identify two distinct corrections which affect the halo redshift-space
correlation function on quasi-linear scales (\texttildelow{}30-80 h-1
Mpc): the non-linear mapping between real-space and redshift-space
positions, and the non-linear suppression of power in the velocity
divergence field. We model the first non-perturbatively using the
scale-dependent Gaussian streaming model, which we show is accurate at
the $<$0.5 (2) per cent level in transforming real-space clustering and
velocity statistics into redshift space on scales s $>$ 10 (s $>$ 25)
h-1 Mpc for the monopole (quadrupole) halo correlation
functions. The dominant correction to the Kaiser limit in this model
scales like b3. We use standard perturbation theory to
predict the real-space pairwise halo velocity statistics. Our fully
analytic model is accurate at the 2 per cent level only on scales s $>$
40 h-1 Mpc for the range of halo masses we studied (with b=
1.4-2.8). We find that recent models of halo redshift-space clustering
that neglect the corrections from the bispectrum and higher order terms
from the non-linear real-space to redshift-space mapping will not have
the accuracy required for current and future observational analyses.
Finally, we note that our simulation results confirm the essential but
non-trivial assumption that on large scales, the bias inferred from the
real-space clustering of haloes is the same as the one that determines
their pairwise infall velocity amplitude at the per cent level.},

The streaming model is often used to model the redshift-space correlation function on small, highly non-linear, scales. There have been claims in the literature, however, that the streaming model is not valid in the linear regime.

  abstract = {Recent observations of the distant Universe suggest that much of the stellar mass of bright galaxies was already in place at z $>$ 1. This presents a challenge for models of galaxy formation because massive haloes are assembled late in the hierarchical clustering process intrinsic to the cold dark matter (CDM) cosmology. In this paper, we discuss a new implementation of the Durham semi-analytic model of galaxy formation in which feedback due to active galactic nuclei (AGN) is assumed to quench cooling flows in massive haloes. This mechanism naturally creates a break in the local galaxy luminosity function at bright magnitudes. The model is implemented within the Millennium N-body simulation. The accurate dark matter merger trees and large number of realizations of the galaxy formation process enabled by this simulation result in highly accurate statistics. After adjusting the values of the physical parameters in the model by reference to the properties of the local galaxy population, we investigate the evolution of the K-band luminosity and galaxy stellar mass functions. We calculate the
volume-averaged star formation rate density of the Universe as a function of redshift and the way in which this is apportioned amongst galaxies of different mass. The model robustly predicts a substantial population of massive galaxies out to redshift z \textasciitilde{} 5 and a star
formation rate density which rises at least out to z \textasciitilde{} 2 in objects of all masses. Although observational data on these properties have been cited as evidence for ‘antihierarchical' galaxy formation, we find that when AGN feedback is taken into account, the fundamentally hierarchical CDM model provides a very good match to these observations.},

  abstract = {We present cosmological results from the final galaxy clustering data set of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey, part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III. Our combined galaxy sample comprises 1.2 million massive galaxies over an effective area of 9329 deg\^2 and volume of 18.7 Gpc\^3, divided into three partially overlapping redshift slices centred at effective redshifts 0.38, 0.51, and 0.61. We measure the angular diameter distance DM and Hubble parameter H from the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) method after applying reconstruction to reduce non-linear effects on the BAO feature. Using the anisotropic clustering of the pre-reconstruction density field, we measure the product DM*H from the Alcock-Paczynski (AP) effect and the growth of structure, quantified by f\{$\backslash$sigma\}8(z), from redshift-space distortions (RSD). We combine measurements presented in seven companion papers into a set of consensus values and likelihoods, obtaining constraints that are tighter and more robust than those from any one method. Combined with Planck 2015 cosmic microwave background measurements, our distance scale measurements simultaneously imply curvature \{$\backslash$Omega\}\_K =0.0003+/-0.0026 and a dark energy equation of state parameter w = -1.01+/-0.06, in strong affirmation of the spatially flat cold dark matter model with a cosmological constant (\{$\backslash$Lambda\}CDM). Our RSD measurements of f\{$\backslash$sigma\}\_8, at 6 per cent precision, are similarly consistent with this model. When combined with supernova Ia data, we find H0 = 67.3+/-1.0 km/s/Mpc even for our most general dark energy model, in tension with some direct measurements. Adding extra relativistic species as a degree of freedom loosens the constraint only slightly, to H0 = 67.8+/-1.2 km/s/Mpc. Assuming flat \{$\backslash$Lambda\}CDM we find \{$\backslash$Omega\}\_m = 0.310+/-0.005 and H0 = 67.6+/-0.5 km/s/Mpc, and we find a 95\% upper limit of 0.16 eV/c\^2 on the neutrino mass sum.},

  abstract = {We examine the growth and evolution of quenched galaxies in the Mufasa cosmological hydrodynamic simulations that include an evolving halo mass-based quenching prescription, with galaxy colours computed accounting for line-of-sight extinction to individual star particles. Mufasa reproduces the observed present-day red sequence quite well, including its slope, amplitude, and scatter. In Mufasa, the red sequence slope is driven entirely by the steep stellar mass-stellar metallicity relation, which independently agrees with observations. High-mass star-forming galaxies blend smoothly onto the red sequence, indicating the lack of a well-defined green valley at M*$>$10\^10.5 Mo. The most massive galaxies quench the earliest and then grow very little in mass via dry merging; they attain their high masses at earlier epochs when cold inflows more effectively penetrate hot halos. To higher redshifts, the red sequence becomes increasingly contaminated with massive dusty star-forming galaxies; UVJ selection subtly but effectively separates these populations. We then examine the evolution of the mass functions of central and satellite galaxies split into passive and star-forming via UVJ. Massive quenched systems show good agreement with observations out to z\textasciitilde{}2, despite not including a rapid early quenching mode associated with mergers. However, low-mass quenched galaxies are far too numerous at z$<$1 in Mufasa, indicating that Mufasa strongly over-quenches satellites. A challenge for hydrodynamic simulations is to devise a quenching model that produces enough early massive quenched galaxies and keeps them quenched to z=0, while not being so strong as to over-quench satellites; Mufasa only succeeds at the former.},

  abstract = {The galaxy stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) is nearly 
time-independent for z $<$ 4. We therefore construct a time-independent SHMR model for central galaxies, wherein the in situ star formation rate (SFR) is determined by the halo mass accretion rate (MAR), which we call stellar halo accretion rate coevolution (SHARC). We show that the \texttildelow{}0.3 dex dispersion of the halo MAR matches the observed
dispersion of the SFR on the star formation main sequence (MS). In the context of ‘bathtub'-type models of galaxy formation, SHARC leads to mass-dependent constraints on the relation between SFR and MAR. Despite its simplicity and the simplified treatment of mass growth from mergers, the SHARC model is likely to be a good approximation for central galaxies with M* = 109-1010.5
M$\odot$ that are on the MS, representing most of the star
formation in the Universe. SHARC predictions agree with observed SFRs for galaxies on the MS at low redshifts, agree fairly well at z \texttildelow{} 4, but exceed observations at z $\greaterequivlnt$ 4. Assuming that the interstellar gas mass is constant for each galaxy (the ‘equilibrium condition' in bathtub models), the SHARC model allows calculation of net mass loading factors for inflowing and outflowing gas. With assumptions about preventive feedback based on simulations, SHARC allows calculation of galaxy metallicity evolution. If galaxy SFRs indeed track halo MARs, especially at low redshifts, that may help explain the success of models linking galaxy properties to haloes (including age-matching) and the similarities between two-halo galaxy conformity and halo mass accretion conformity.},

  shorttitle = {Dark Matter Statistics for Large Galaxy Catalogs},
  abstract = {Upcoming and existing large-scale surveys of galaxies require accurate theoretical predictions of the dark matter clustering statistics for thousands of mock galaxy catalogs. We demonstrate that this goal can be achieve with our new Parallel Particle-Mesh (PM) Nbody code (PPM-GLAM) at a very low computational cost. We run about 15,000 simulations with \textasciitilde{}2 billion particles that provide \textasciitilde{}1\% accuracy of the dark matter power spectra P(k) for wave-numbers up to k\textasciitilde{} 1h/Mpc. Using this large data-set we study the power spectrum covariance matrix, the stepping stone for producing mock catalogs. In contrast to many previous analytical and numerical results, we find that the covariance matrix normalised to the power spectrum C(k,k')/P(k)P(k') has a complex structure of non-diagonal components. It has an upturn at small k, followed by a minimum at k=0.1-0.2h/Mpc. It also has a maximum at k=0.5-0.6h/Mpc. The normalised covariance matrix strongly evolves with redshift: C(k,k')\textasciitilde{}delta(t)\^alpha P(k)P(k'), where delta is the linear growth factor and alpha \textasciitilde{} 1-1.25, which indicates that the covariance matrix depends on cosmological parameters. We also show that waves longer than 1Gpc have very little impact on the power spectrum and covariance matrix. This significantly reduces the computational costs and complexity of theoretical predictions: relatively small volume \textasciitilde{} (1Gpc)\^3 simulations capture the necessary properties of dark matter clustering statistics. All the power spectra obtained from many thousands of our simulations are publicly available.},

We discuss how one can use this information to determine the mean of the galaxy halo occupation distribution (HOD) using only large-scale information, through galaxy bias parameters determined from the galaxy bispectrum and trispectrum. After introducing an averaged, reasonably fast to evaluate, trispectrum estimator, we show that the expected errors on linear and quadratic bias parameters can be reduced by at least 20-40\%. Also, the inclusion of the trispectrum information, which is sensitive to "three-dimensionality" of structures, helps significantly in constraining the mass dependence of the HOD mean. Our approach depends only on adequate modeling of the abundance and large-scale clustering of halos and thus is independent of details of how galaxies are distributed within halos. This provides a consistency check on the traditional approach of using two-point statistics down to small scales, which necessarily makes more assumptions. We present a detailed forecast of how well our approach can be carried out in the case of the SDSS.},

the matter density $\Omega$m, power spectrum normalization

circumventing the linear theory distortion parameter $\beta$ and
eliminating nuisance parameters for non-linearities. The model is
constructed within the framework of the halo occupation distribution
(HOD), which quantifies galaxy bias on linear and non-linear scales. We
model one-halo pairwise velocities by assuming that satellite galaxy
velocities follow a Gaussian distribution with dispersion proportional
to the virial dispersion of the host halo. Two-halo velocity statistics
are a combination of virial motions and host halo motions. The velocity
distribution function (DF) of halo pairs is a complex function with
skewness and kurtosis that vary substantially with scale. Using a series
of collisionless N-body simulations, we demonstrate that the shape of
the velocity DF is determined primarily by the distribution of local
densities around a halo pair, and at fixed density the velocity DF is
close to Gaussian and nearly independent of halo mass. We calibrate a
model for the conditional probability function of densities around halo
pairs on these simulations. With this model, the full shape of the halo
velocity DF can be accurately calculated as a function of halo mass,
radial separation, angle and cosmology. The HOD approach to
redshift-space distortions utilizes clustering data from linear to
non-linear scales to break the standard degeneracies inherent in
previous models of redshift-space clustering. The parameters of the
occupation function are well constrained by real-space clustering alone,
separating constraints on bias and cosmology. We demonstrate the ability
of the model to separately constrain
$\Omega$m,$\sigma$8 and $\alpha$v in
models that are constructed to have the same value of $\beta$ at large
scales as well as the same finger-of-god distortions at small scales.},

beyond the baryon acoustic oscillation feature. This model also agrees
remarkably well with the BOSS galaxy power spectrum (up to k \texttildelow{} 1 h
Mpc-1), and the three-point correlation function. The
quadrupole of the correlation function presents some tensions with
observations. We discuss possible causes that can explain this
disagreement, including target selection effects. Overall, the standard

We stress the importance of nonlinear effects and show that inaccurate treatment of these can lead to significant discrepancies in the determination of bias from galaxy redshift surveys.

Here we review the current status of models that employ two leading techniques to simulate the physics of galaxy formation: semi-analytic models and numerical hydrodynamic simulations. We focus on a set of observational targets that describe the evolution of the global and structural properties of galaxies from roughly Cosmic High Noon (\$z$\backslash$sim 2-3\$) to the present. Although minor discrepancies remain, overall, models show remarkable convergence between different methods and make predictions that are in qualitative agreement with observations. Modelers seem to have converged on a core set of physical processes that are critical for shaping galaxy properties. This core set includes cosmological accretion, strong stellar-driven winds that are more efficient at low masses, black hole feedback that preferentially suppresses star formation at high masses, and structural and morphological evolution through merging and environmental processes. However, all cosmological models currently adopt phenomenological implementations of many of these core processes, which must be tuned to observations. Many details of how these diverse processes interact within a hierarchical structure formation setting remain poorly understood. Emerging multi-scale simulations are helping to bridge the gap between stellar and cosmological scales, placing models on a firmer, more physically grounded footing. Concurrently, upcoming telescope facilities will provide new challenges and constraints for models, particularly by directly constraining inflows and outflows through observations of gas in and around galaxies.},

nongaseous 'dark matter', apparently making up about 80\% or more of the
virial mass in clusters such as Coma and which may constitute massive
halos around large galaxies. At work is a process of self-similar
gravitational clustering in an expanding universe. The clustering builds
up in hierarchical fashion; the smaller-scale virialized systems merge
into an amorphous whole when they are incorporated in a larger bound
cluster. Residual gas in the resulting potential wells cools and
acquires sufficient concentration to self-gravitate, forming luminous
galaxies up to a limiting size. This limit agrees adequately with the
masses, luminosities, and radii of large galaxies. On certain specific
assumptions, a luminosity function is derived that agrees reasonably
well with observation.},

the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds (SMC and LMC) provokes questions
of their origins, and what they can reveal about galaxy evolution
theory. Here, we predict the satellite stellar mass function of
Magellanic Cloud-mass host galaxies using abundance matching and
reionization models applied to the Caterpillar simulations. Specifically
focusing on the volume within 50 kpc of the LMC, we predict a mean of
4-8 satellites with stellar mass \$M\_* $>$ 10\^4 $\backslash$, $\backslash$mathrm\{M\_$\backslash$odot\}\$,
and 3-4 satellites with \$80 $<$ M\_* $\backslash$leq 3000 $\backslash$, $\backslash$mathrm\{M\_$\backslash$odot\}\$.
Surprisingly, all \$12\$ currently known satellite candidates have stellar
masses of \$80 $<$ M\_* $\backslash$leq 3000 $\backslash$, $\backslash$mathrm\{M\_$\backslash$odot\}\$. Reconciling the
dearth of large satellites and profusion of small satellites is
challenging and may require a combination of a major modification of the
\$M\_* - M\_\{$\backslash$rm\{halo\}\}\$ relationship (steep, but with an abrupt flattening
at \$10\^3 $\backslash$, $\backslash$mathrm\{M\_$\backslash$odot\}\$), late reionization for the Local Group
(\$z\_\{$\backslash$rm\{reion\}\} $\backslash$lesssim 9\$ preferred), and/or strong tidal stripping.
We can more robustly predict that \$$\backslash$sim 53$\backslash$\%\$ of satellites within this
volume were accreted together with the LMC and SMC, and \$$\backslash$sim 47$\backslash$\%\$ were
only ever Milky Way satellites. Observing satellites of isolated
LMC-sized field galaxies is essential to placing the LMC in context, and
to better constrain the \$M\_* - M\_\{$\backslash$rm\{halo\}\}\$ relationship. Modeling
known LMC-sized galaxies within \$8\$ Mpc, we predict 1-6 (2-12)

This dependence on the formation history, which is highly correlated with halo concentration, can account for the super-Poissonian scatter in subhalo occupation at a fixed halo mass that has been previously measured in simulations. Here we propose a model to predict the subhalo abundance function for individual host halos that incorporates both halo mass and concentration. We combine results of cosmological simulations with a new suite of zoom-in simulations of Milky Way-mass halos to calibrate our model. We show that the model can successfully reproduce the mean and the scatter of subhalo occupation in these simulations. The implications of this correlation between subhalo abundance and halo concentration are further investigated. We also discuss cases in which inferences about halo properties can be affected if this correlation between subhalo abundance and halo concentration is ignored; in these cases, our model would give a more accurate inference. We propose that with future deep surveys, satellite occupation in the low-mass regime can be used to verify the existence of halo assembly bias.},

  abstract = {In order to be efficient, spectroscopic galaxy redshift surveys do not obtain redshifts for all galaxies in the population targeted. The missing galaxies are often clustered, commonly leading to a lower proportion of successful observations in dense regions. One example is the close-pair issue for SDSS spectroscopic galaxy surveys, which have a deficit of pairs of observed galaxies with angular separation closer than the hardware limit on placing neighbouring fibers. Spatially clustered missing observations will exist in the next generations of surveys. Various schemes have previously been suggested to mitigate these effects, but none works for all situations. We argue that the solution is to link the missing galaxies to those observed with
statistically equivalent clustering properties, and that the best way to do this is to rerun the targeting algorithm, varying the angular position of the observations. Provided that every pair has a non-zero probability of being observed in one realisation of the algorithm, then a pair-upweighting scheme linking targets to successful observations, can correct these issues. We present such a scheme, and demonstrate its validity using realisations of an idealised simple survey strategy.},

  abstract = {Reliable extraction of cosmological information from clustering measurements of galaxy surveys requires estimation of the error covariance matrices of observables. The accuracy of covariance matrices is limited by our ability to generate sufficiently large number of independent mock catalogs that can describe the physics of galaxy clustering across a wide range of scales. Furthermore, galaxy mock catalogs are required to study systematics in galaxy surveys and to test analysis tools. In this investigation, we present a fast and accurate approach for generation of mock catalogs for the upcoming galaxy surveys. Our method relies on low-resolution approximate gravity solvers to simulate the large scale dark matter field, which we then populate with halos according to a flexible nonlinear and stochastic bias model. In particular, we extend the patchy code with an efficient particle mesh algorithm to simulate the dark matter field (the FastPM code), and with an efficient and robust MCMC method relying on the emcee code for constraining the parameters of the bias model. Using the halos in the BigMultiDark high-resolution \$N\$-body simulation as a reference catalog, we demonstrate that our technique can model the bivariate probability distribution function, power spectrum, and bispectrum of halos in the reference catalog. Specifically, we show that the new ingredients permit us to reach percentage accuracy in the power spectrum up to \$k$\backslash$sim 0.4$\backslash$; h$\backslash$mathrm\{Mpc\}\^\{-1\}\$ (within 5\$$\backslash$\%\$ up to \$k$\backslash$sim 0.6$\backslash$; h$\backslash$mathrm\{Mpc\}\^\{-1\}\$) with accurate bispectra improving previous results based on Lagrangian perturbation theory.},

  abstract = {Clustering of dark matter halos has been shown to depend on halo properties beyond mass such as halo concentration, a phenomenon referred to as halo assembly bias. Standard halo occupation modeling (HOD) in large scale structure studies assumes that halo mass alone is sufficient in characterizing the connection between galaxies and halos. Modeling of galaxy clustering can face systematic effects if the number of galaxies are correlated with other halo properties. Using the Small MultiDark-Planck high resolution \$N\$-body simulation and the measurements of the projected two-point correlation function and the number density of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR7 main galaxy sample, we investigate the extent to which the dependence of halo occupation on halo concentration can be constrained, and to what extent allowing for this dependence can improve our modeling of galaxy clustering. Given the SDSS clustering data, our constraints on HOD with assembly bias, suggests that satellite population is not correlated with halo concentration at fixed halo mass. Furthermore, in terms of the occupation of centrals at fixed halo mass, our results favor lack of correlation with halo concentration in the most luminous samples (\$M\_\{$\backslash$rm r\}$<$-21.5,-21\$), modest levels of correlation for \$M\_\{$\backslash$rm r\}$<$-20.5,-20, -19.5\$ samples, lack of correlation for \$M\_\{$\backslash$rm r\}$<$-19,-18.5\$ samples, and anti-correlation for the faintest sample \$M\_\{$\backslash$rm r\}$<$-18\$. We show that in comparison with abundance-matching mock catalogs, our findings suggest qualitatively similar but modest levels of the impact of assembly bias on galaxy clustering. That is, the effect is only present in the central occupation and becomes less significant in brighter galaxy samples. Furthermore, by performing model comparison based on information criteria, we find that in most cases, the mass-only HOD model is still favored by the observations.},

  abstract = {Massive neutrinos make up a fraction of the dark matter, but due to 
their large thermal velocities, cluster significantly less than cold
dark matter (CDM) on small scales. An accurate theoretical modelling of
their effect during the non-linear regime of structure formation is
required in order to properly analyse current and upcoming
high-precision large-scale structure data, and constrain the neutrino
mass. Taking advantage of the fact that massive neutrinos remain
linearly clustered up to late times, this paper treats the linear growth
of neutrino overdensities in a non-linear CDM background. The evolution
of the CDM component is obtained via N-body computations. The smooth
neutrino component is evaluated from that background by solving the
Boltzmann equation linearized with respect to the neutrino overdensity.
CDM and neutrinos are simultaneously evolved in time, consistently
accounting for their mutual gravitational influence. This method avoids
the issue of shot noise inherent to particle-based neutrino simulations,
and, in contrast with standard Fourier-space methods, properly accounts
for the non-linear potential wells in which the neutrinos evolve. Inside
the most massive late-time clusters, where the escape velocity is larger
than the neutrino thermal velocity, neutrinos can clump non-linearly,
causing the method to formally break down. It is shown that this does
not affect the total matter power spectrum, which can be very accurately
computed on all relevant scales up to the present time.},

We find that the larger values of \$$\backslash$sigma\_8\$ and \$$\backslash$Omega\_\{$\backslash$mathrm\{m\}\}\$ preferred by Planck's measurements of the primary CMB anisotropies can be accommodated by a mass bias of about 40\%. Alternatively, consistency with the primary CMB constraints can be achieved by inclusion of processes that suppress power on small scales relative to the \$$\backslash$Lambda\$CDM model, such as a component of massive neutrinos (abridged).},

  abstract = {I present a comprehensive review of the evolution of galaxy structure in the universe from the first galaxies we can currently observe at z\textasciitilde{}6 down to galaxies we see in the local universe. I further address how these changes reveal galaxy formation processes that galaxy structural analyses can provide. This review is pedagogical and begins with a detailed discussion of the major methods in which galaxies are studied morphologically and structurally. This includes the well-established visual method; Sersic fitting to measure galaxy sizes and surface brightness profile shapes; non-parametric structural methods including the concentration (C), asymmetry (A), clumpiness (S) (CAS) method, as well as newer structural indices. Included is a discussion of how these structural indices measure fundamental properties of galaxies such as their scale, star formation rate, and ongoing merger activity. Extensive observational results are shown demonstrating how broad galaxy morphologies and structures change with time up to z\textasciitilde{}3, from small, compact and peculiar systems in the distant universe to the formation of the Hubble sequence we find today. This review further addresses how structural methods measure accurately the merger history out to z\textasciitilde{}3. The properties and evolution of bulges, disks, bars, and at z$>$1 large star forming clumps are also described, along with how morphological galaxy quenching occurs. Furthermore, the role of environment in producing structure in galaxies over cosmic time is treated. Alongside the evolution of general structure, I also delineate how galaxy sizes change with time, with measured sizes up to a factor of 2-5 smaller at high redshift at a given stellar mass. This review concludes with a discussion of how galaxy structure reveals the formation mechanisms behind galaxies, providing a new and unique way to test theories of galaxy formation.},

  abstract = {We use the hydrodynamical galaxy formation simulations from the Illustris suite to study the origin and properties of galaxy velocity bias, i.e., the difference between the velocity distributions of galaxies and dark matter inside halos. We find that galaxy velocity bias is a decreasing function of the ratio of galaxy stellar mass to host halo mass. In general, central galaxies are not at rest with respect to dark matter halos or the core of halos, with a velocity dispersion above 0.04 times that of the dark matter. The central galaxy velocity bias is found to be mostly caused by the close interactions between the central and satellite galaxies. For satellite galaxies, the velocity bias is related to their dynamical and tidal evolution history after being accreted onto the host halos. It depends on the time after the accretion and their distances from the halo centers, with massive satellites generally moving more slowly than the dark matter. The results are in broad agreements with those inferred from modeling small-scale redshift-space galaxy clustering data, and the study can help improve models of redshift-space galaxy clustering.},

  abstract = {We present accurate photometric redshifts for galaxies observed by the Cluster Lensing and Supernova survey with Hubble (CLASH). CLASH observed 25 massive galaxy cluster cores with the Hubble Space Telescope in 16 filters spanning 0.2 - 1.7 \$$\backslash$mu\$m. Photometry in such crowded fields is challenging. Compared to our previously released catalogs, we make several improvements to the photometry, including smaller apertures, ICL subtraction, PSF matching, and empirically measured uncertainties. We further improve the Bayesian Photometric Redshift (BPZ) estimates by adding a redder elliptical template and by inflating the photometric uncertainties of the brightest galaxies. The resulting photometric redshift accuracies are dz/(1+z) \$$\backslash$sim\$ 0.8$\backslash$\%, 1.0$\backslash$\%, and 2.0$\backslash$\% for galaxies with I-band F814W AB magnitudes \$$<$\$ 18, 20, and 23, respectively. These results are consistent with our expectations. They improve on our previously reported accuracies by a factor of 4 at the bright end and a factor of 2 at the faint end. Our new catalog includes 1257 spectroscopic redshifts, including 382 confirmed cluster members. We also provide stellar mass estimates. Finally, we include lensing magnification estimates of background galaxies based on our public lens models. Our new catalog of all 25 CLASH clusters is available via MAST. The analysis techniques developed here will be useful in other surveys of crowded fields, including the Frontier Fields and surveys carried out with J-PAS and JWST.},

  shorttitle = {Revisiting {{HOD}} Model Assumptions},
  abstract = {The standard Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) models were originally developed based on results from semi-analytic and hydrodynamical galaxy formation models. Those models have since progressed, in particular to include AGN feedback to match the galaxy luminosity function in a universe with the observed baryon fraction. AGN feedback affects the relationship between galaxy stellar mass and luminosity, in particular making the relationship non-monotonic. For matched number density samples, galaxies in luminosity-threshold samples occupy a different range of halo masses from those in stellar-mass-threshold samples. We find that the shapes of the HODs of luminosity-threshold samples are slightly more complicated in semi-analytic galaxy formation models that include AGN feedback than are assumed by standard HOD models. We also find that subhalo abundance matching (SHAM) does not preserve these non-standard shapes. We show that catalogues created using SHAM and the semi-analytic model Galform that have the same large-scale 2-point clustering by construction have different void probability functions (VPFs) in both real and redshift space. We find that these differences arise from the different HOD shapes, as opposed to assembly bias, which indicates that the VPF could be used to test the suitability of an HOD model with real data.},

  abstract = {We investigate the environmental quenching of galaxies, especially those with stellar mass (M*)\$$<$10\^\{9.5\} M\_$\backslash$odot\$, beyond the local universe. Essentially all local low-mass quenched galaxies (QGs) are believed to live close to massive central galaxies, which is a demonstration of environmental quenching. We use CANDELS data to test \{$\backslash$it whether or not\} such a dwarf QG--massive central galaxy connection exists beyond the local universe. To this purpose, we only need a statistically representative, rather than a complete, sample of low-mass galaxies, which enables our study to \$z$\backslash$gtrsim1.5\$. For each low-mass galaxy, we measure the projected distance (\$d\_\{proj\}\$) to its nearest massive neighbor (M*\$$>$10\^\{10.5\} M\_$\backslash$odot\$) within a redshift range. At a given redshift and M*, the environmental quenching effect is considered to be observed if the \$d\_\{proj\}\$ distribution of QGs (\$d\_\{proj\}\^Q\$) is significantly skewed toward lower values than that of star-forming galaxies (\$d\_\{proj\}\^\{SF\}\$). For galaxies with \$10\^\{8\} M\_$\backslash$odot $<$ M* $<$ 10\^\{10\} M\_$\backslash$odot\$, such a difference between \$d\_\{proj\}\^Q\$ and \$d\_\{proj\}\^\{SF\}\$ is detected up to \$z$\backslash$sim1\$. Also, about 10$\backslash$\% of the quenched galaxies in our sample are located between two and four Virial Radius (\$R\_\{Vir\}\$) of the massive halos. The median projected distance from low-mass QGs to their massive neighbors, \$d\_\{proj\}\^Q / R\_\{Vir\}\$, decreases with satellite M* at \$M* $\backslash$lesssim 10\^\{9.5\} M\_$\backslash$odot\$, but increases with satellite M* at \$M* $\backslash$gtrsim 10\^\{9.5\} M\_$\backslash$odot\$. This trend suggests a smooth, if any, transition of the quenching timescale around \$M* $\backslash$sim 10\^\{9.5\} M\_$\backslash$odot\$ at \$0.5$<$z$<$1.0\$.},

  abstract = {We introduce a new methodology for the direct extraction of galaxy physical parameters from multi-wavelength photometry and spectroscopy. We use semi-analytic models that describe galaxy evolution in the context of large scale cosmological simulation to provide a catalog of galaxies, star formation histories, and physical parameters. We then apply stellar population synthesis models and a simple extinction model to calculate the observable broad-band fluxes and spectral indices for these galaxies. We use a linear regression analysis to relate physical parameters to observed colors and spectral indices. The result is a set of coefficients that can be used to translate observed colors and indices into stellar mass, star formation rate, and many other parameters, including the instantaneous time derivative of the star formation rate which we denote the \{$\backslash$it Star Formation Acceleration (SFA)\}, We apply the method to a test sample of galaxies with GALEX photometry and SDSS spectroscopy, deriving relationships between stellar mass, specific star formation rate, and star formation acceleration. We find evidence for a mass-dependent SFA in the green valley, with low mass galaxies showing greater quenching and higher mass galaxies greater bursting. We also find evidence for an increase in average quenching in galaxies hosting AGN. A simple scenario in which lower mass galaxies accrete and become satellite galaxies, having their star forming gas tidally and/or ram-pressure stripped, while higher mass galaxies receive this gas and react with new star formation can qualitatively explain our results.},

  abstract = {We present the final data release from the GALEX Arecibo SDSS Survey 
(GASS), a large Arecibo programme that measured the H I properties for
an unbiased sample of \texttildelow{}800 galaxies with stellar masses greater
than 1010 M$\odot$ and redshifts 0.025 $<$ z $<$
0.05. This release includes new Arecibo observations for 250 galaxies.
We use the full GASS sample to investigate environmental effects on the
cold gas content of massive galaxies at fixed stellar mass. The
environment is characterized in terms of dark matter halo mass, obtained
by cross-matching our sample with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)
group catalogue of Yang et al. Our analysis provides, for the first
time, clear statistical evidence that massive galaxies located in haloes
with masses of 1013-1014 M$\odot$ have at
least 0.4 dex less H I than objects in lower density environments. The

  title = {Brightest Galaxies as Halo Centre Tracers in {{SDSS DR7}}},
  abstract = {Determining the positions of halo centres in large-scale structure surveys is crucial for many cosmological studies. A common assumption is that halo centres correspond to the location of their brightest member galaxies. In this paper, we study the dynamics of brightest galaxies with respect to other halo members in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR7. Specifically, we look at the line-of-sight velocity and spatial offsets between brightest galaxies and their neighbours. We compare those to detailed mock catalogues, constructed from high-resolution, dark-matter-only \$N\$-body simulations, in which it is assumed that satellite galaxies trace dark matter subhaloes. This allows us to place constraints on the fraction \$f\_\{$\backslash$rm BNC\}\$ of haloes in which the brightest galaxy is not the central. Compared to previous studies we explicitly take into account the unrelaxed state of the host haloes, velocity offsets of halo cores and correlations between \$f\_\{$\backslash$rm BNC\}\$ and the satellite occupation. We find that \$f\_\{$\backslash$rm BNC\}\$ strongly decreases with the luminosity of the brightest galaxy and increases with the mass of the host halo. Overall, in the halo mass range \$10\^\{13\} - 10\^\{14.5\} h\^\{-1\} M\_$\backslash$odot\$ we find \$f\_\{$\backslash$rm BNC\} $\backslash$sim 30$\backslash$\%\$, in good agreement with a previous study by Skibba et al. We discuss the implications of these findings for studies inferring the galaxy--halo connection from satellite kinematics, models of the conditional luminosity function and galaxy formation in general.},

  abstract = {We present EMERGE, an Empirical ModEl for the foRmation of GalaxiEs, describing the evolution of individual galaxies in large volumes from \$z$\backslash$sim10\$ to the present day. We assign a star formation rate to each dark matter halo based on its growth rate, which specifies how much baryonic material becomes available, and the instantaneous baryon conversion efficiency, which determines how efficiently this material is converted to stars, thereby capturing the baryonic physics. Satellites are quenched following the delayed-then-rapid model, and they are tidally disrupted once their subhalo has lost a significant fraction of its mass. The model is constrained with observed data extending out to high redshift. The empirical relations are very flexible, and the model complexity is increased only if required by the data, assessed by several model selection statistics. We find that for the same final halo mass galaxies can have very different star formation histories. Nevertheless, the average star formation and accretion rates are in good agreement with models following an abundance matching strategy. Galaxies that are quenched at \$z=0\$ typically have a higher peak star formation rate compared to their star-forming counterparts. The accretion of stars can dominate the total mass of massive galaxies, but is insignificant for low-mass systems, independent of star-formation activity. EMERGE predicts stellar-to-halo mass ratios for individual galaxies and introduces scatter self-consistently. We find that at fixed halo mass, passive galaxies have a higher stellar mass on average. The intra-cluster-mass in massive haloes can be up to 8 times larger than the mass of the central galaxy. Clustering for star-forming and quenched galaxies is in good agreement with observational constraints, indicating a realistic assignment of galaxies to haloes.},

However, obtaining spectra of galaxies is expensive, and surveys often only measure redshifts for a subsample of a target galaxy population. Provided that the spectroscopic data is representative, we argue that angular pair upweighting should be used in these situations to improve the 3D clustering measurements. We present a toy model showing mathematically how such a weighting can improve measurements, and provide a practical example of its application using mocks created for the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). Our analysis of mocks suggests that, if an angular clustering measurement is available over twice the area covered spectroscopically, weighting gives a \$$\backslash$sim\$10-20\% reduction of the variance of the monopole correlation function on the BAO scale.},

  title = {Galactic Conformity Measured in Semi-Analytic Models},
  abstract = {We study the correlation between the specific star formation rate of central galaxies and neighbour galaxies, also known as 'galactic conformity', out to several Mpc scales using three different semi-analytic models (SAMs). It has been suggested that SAMs may not show the strong signal of conformity measured in observations. In all the models, when the selection of primary galaxies is based on an isolation criterion in real space, we measure a strong galactic conformity where the mean quenched fraction around quenched primary galaxies is higher than that around star-forming primary galaxies of the same stellar mass. The cumulative signal-to-noise ratio, which is used to evaluate the significance and extension in distance of conformity, depends strongly on the SAM. The two-halo conformity is significant as far as \textasciitilde{}5 Mpc/h. The overall signal of galactic conformity decreases when we remove satellites in the selection of primary galaxies. In this case, there is no significant two-halo conformity in two SAMs. For the other SAM, the two-halo conformity is only detected between isolated, central galaxies in relatively low-mass haloes (\$M\_\{$\backslash$rm halo\}\$ \$$<$ 10\^\{12.4\}\$ \$h\^\{-1\}\textasciitilde$\backslash$rm\{ M\_\{$\backslash$bigodot\}\}\$) and their neighbours. Finally, we explore the case when the secondary galaxies correspond to central galaxies in the SAMs as an attempt to measure the conformity between distinct haloes. Our results show that there is no conformity beyond \textasciitilde{}3 Mpc/h. The conformity measured out to scales of 3\$-\$4 Mpc/h can be related to the environmental influence of large galaxy clusters around near central galaxies.},

  title = {Large-{{Scale Galaxy Bias}}},
  abstract = {This review presents a comprehensive overview of galaxy bias, that is, the statistical relation between the distribution of galaxies and matter. We focus on large scales where cosmic density fields are quasi-linear. On these scales, the clustering of galaxies can be described by a perturbative bias expansion, and the complicated physics of galaxy formation is absorbed by a finite set of coefficients of the expansion, called bias parameters. The review begins with a detailed derivation of this very important result, which forms the basis of the rigorous perturbative description of galaxy clustering, under the assumptions of General Relativity and Gaussian, adiabatic initial conditions. Key components of the bias expansion are all leading local gravitational observables, which include the matter density but also tidal fields and their time derivatives. We hence expand the definition of local bias to encompass all these contributions. This derivation is followed by a presentation of the peak-background split in its general form, which elucidates the physical meaning of the bias parameters, and a detailed description of the connection between bias parameters and galaxy (or halo) statistics. We then review the excursion set formalism and peak theory which provide predictions for the values of the bias parameters. In the remainder of the review, we consider the generalizations of galaxy bias required in the presence of various types of cosmological physics that go beyond pressureless matter with adiabatic, Gaussian initial conditions: primordial non-Gaussianity, massive neutrinos, baryon-CDM isocurvature perturbations, dark energy, and modified gravity. Finally, we discuss how the description of galaxy bias in the galaxies' rest frame is related to clustering statistics measured from the observed angular positions and redshifts in actual galaxy catalogs.},

  abstract = {We investigate whether a Gaussian likelihood, as routinely assumed in the analysis of cosmological data, is supported by simulated survey data. We define test statistics, based on a novel method that first destroys Gaussian correlations in a dataset, and then measures the non-Gaussian correlations that remain. This procedure flags pairs of datapoints which depend on each other in a non-Gaussian fashion, and thereby identifies where the assumption of a Gaussian likelihood breaks down. Using this diagnostic, we find that non-Gaussian correlations in the CFHTLenS cosmic shear correlation functions are significant. With a simple exclusion of the most contaminated datapoints, the posterior for \$s\_8\$ is shifted without broadening, but we find no significant reduction in the tension with \$s\_8\$ derived from Planck Cosmic Microwave Background data. However, we also show that the one-point distributions of the correlation statistics are noticeably skewed, such that sound weak lensing data sets are intrinsically likely to lead to a systematically low lensing amplitude being inferred. The detected non-Gaussianities get larger with increasing angular scale such that for future wide-angle surveys such as Euclid or LSST, with their very small statistical errors, the large-scale modes are expected to be increasingly affected. The shifts in posteriors may then not be negligible and we recommend that these diagnostic tests be run as part of future analyses.},

Yet on length scales smaller than \$$\backslash$sim 1\$ Mpc and mass scales smaller than \$$\backslash$sim 10\^\{11\} M\_\{$\backslash$odot\}\$, the theory faces a number of challenges. For example, the observed cores of many dark-matter dominated galaxies are both less dense and less cuspy than naively predicted in \$$\backslash$Lambda\$CDM. The number of small galaxies and dwarf satellites in the Local Group is also far below the predicted count of low-mass dark matter halos and subhalos within similar volumes. These issues underlie the most well-documented problems with \$$\backslash$Lambda\$CDM: Cusp/Core, Missing Satellites, and Too-Big-to-Fail. The key question is whether a better understanding of baryon physics, dark matter physics, or both will be required to meet these challenges. Other anomalies, including the observed planar and orbital configurations of Local Group satellites and the tight baryonic/dark matter scaling relations obeyed by the galaxy population, have been less thoroughly explored in the context of \$$\backslash$Lambda\$CDM theory. Future surveys to discover faint, distant dwarf galaxies and to precisely measure their masses and density structure hold promising avenues for testing possible solutions to the small-scale challenges going forward. Observational programs to constrain or discover and characterize the number of truly dark low-mass halos are among the most important, and achievable, goals in this field over then next decade. These efforts will either further verify the \$$\backslash$Lambda\$CDM paradigm or demand a substantial revision in our understanding of the nature of dark matter.},

  abstract = {Stellar mass has been shown to correlate with halo mass, with non-negligible scatter. The stellar mass-size and luminosity-size relationships of galaxies also show significant scatter in galaxy size at fixed stellar mass. It is possible that, at fixed stellar mass and galaxy colour, the halo mass is correlated with galaxy size. Galaxy-galaxy lensing allows us to measure the mean masses of dark matter haloes for stacked samples of galaxies. We extend the analysis of the galaxies in the CFHTLenS catalogue by fitting single S$\backslash$'\{e\}rsic surface brightness profiles to the lens galaxies in order to recover half-light radius values, allowing us to determine halo masses for lenses according to their size. Comparing our halo masses and sizes to baselines for that stellar mass yields a differential measurement of the halo mass-galaxy size relationship at fixed stellar mass, defined as \$M\_\{h\}(M\_\{*\}) $\backslash$propto r\_\{$\backslash$mathrm\{eff\}\}\^\{$\backslash$eta\}(M\_\{*\})\$. We find that on average, our lens galaxies have an \$$\backslash$eta = 0.42$\backslash$pm0.12\$, i.e. larger galaxies live in more massive dark matter haloes. The \$$\backslash$eta\$ is strongest for high mass luminous red galaxies (LRGs). Investigation of this relationship in hydrodynamical simulations suggests that, at a fixed \$M\_\{*\}\$, satellite galaxies have a larger \$$\backslash$eta\$ and greater scatter in the \$M\_\{$\backslash$mathrm\{h\}\}\$ and \$r\_\{$\backslash$mathrm\{eff\}\}\$ relationship compared to central galaxies.},

We aim for our method to be able to distinguish between five models, which were chosen to lie along the \$$\backslash$sigma \_8\$ - \$$\backslash$Omega \_m\$ degeneracy, and have nearly the same two-point statistics. We design and implement a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) which learns the relation between five cosmological models and the mass maps they generate. We develop a new training strategy which ensures the good performance of the network for high levels of noise. We compare the performance of this approach to commonly used non-Gaussian statistics, namely the skewness and kurtosis of the convergence maps. We find that our implementation of DCNN outperforms the skewness and kurtosis statistics, especially for high noise levels. The network maintains the mean discrimination efficiency greater than \$85$\backslash$\%\$ even for noise levels corresponding to ground based lensing observations, while the other statistics perform worse in this setting, achieving efficiency less than \$70$\backslash$\%\$. This demonstrates the ability of CNN-based methods to efficiently break the \$$\backslash$sigma \_8\$ - \$$\backslash$Omega \_m\$ degeneracy with weak lensing mass maps alone.

Observational qualitative trends of size with stellar mass, star-formation rate and redshift are reproduced, and a quantitative comparison of projected r-band sizes at 0\textasciitilde$<$z$<$\textasciitilde{}2 shows agreement to better than 0.25dex. We follow populations of z=0 galaxies with a range of masses backwards in time along their main progenitor branches, separately for main-sequence and quenched galaxies. Our main findings are as follows. (i) At \$M\_\{*,z=0\}$>$\textasciitilde{}10\^\{9.5\}\$M\$\_$\backslash$odot\$, the main progenitors evolve in different ways, with quenched galaxies hardly growing in median size before quenching, whereas main-sequence galaxies grow their median size continuously, thus opening a gap from the progenitors of quenched galaxies. This is partly because the main-sequence high-redshift progenitors of quenched z=0 galaxies are drawn from the lower end of the size distribution of the overall population of main-sequence high-redshift galaxies. (ii) Quenched galaxies with \$M\_\{*,z=0\}$>$\textasciitilde{}10\^\{9.5\}\$M\$\_$\backslash$odot\$ experience a steep size growth on the size-mass plane after their quenching time, but the size growth rate as a function of time is similar to that of main-sequence galaxies. Hence, the size gap is not closed by z=0. (iii) At all masses but \$M\_\{*,z=0\}$>$10\^\{11\}\$M\$\_$\backslash$odot\$, most of the size (and mass) growth of quenched galaxies occurs while they are still on the main-sequence, and the size variation among quenched galaxies is driven by different degrees of growth on the main-sequence rather than after quenching.},

  abstract = {The average star formation rate (SFR) in galaxies has been declining since redshift of 2. A fraction of galaxies quench and become quiescent. We constrain two key properties of the quenching process: the quenching time scale and the quenching rate among galaxies. We achieve this by analyzing the galaxy number density profile in NUV-u color space and the distribution in NUV-u v.s. u-i color-color diagram with a simple toy-model framework. We focus on galaxies in three mass bins between 10 to 10 and 10 to 10.6 solar mass. In the NUV-u v.s. u-i color-color diagram, the red u-i galaxies exhibit a different slope from the slope traced by the star-forming galaxies. This angled distribution and the number density profile of galaxies in NUV-u space strongly suggest that the decline of the SFR in galaxies has to accelerate before they turn quiescent. We model this color-color distribution with a two-phase exponential decline star formation history. The models with an e-folding time in the second phase (the quenching phase) of 0.5 Gyr best fit the data. We further use the NUV-u number density profile to constrain the quenching rate among star-forming galaxies as a function of mass. Adopting an e-folding time of 0.5 Gyr in the second phase (or the quenching phase), we found the quenching rate to be 19\%/Gyr, 25\%/Gyr and 33\%/Gyr for the three mass bins. These are upper limits of quenching rate as the transition zone could also be populated by rejuvenated red-sequence galaxies.},

Understanding of galaxy evolution rests on longitudinal interpretations of how these data relate to individual objects moving through time. The connection between the two is generally assumed to be clear, but we use a simple "physics-free" model to show that it is not and that exploring its nuances can lead to new insights. Comprising nothing more than \$$\backslash$sim2000\$ loosely constrained lognormal star formation histories, the model faithfully reproduces the following data it was never designed to match: stellar mass functions at \$z$\backslash$leq8\$; the slope of the star formation rate/stellar mass relation (the SF "Main Sequence") at \$z$\backslash$leq6\$; the mean \$\{$\backslash$rm sSFR\}($\backslash$equiv\{$\backslash$rm SFR\}/M\_*)\$ of low-mass galaxies at \$z$\backslash$leq7\$; "fast-" and "slow-track quenching"; galaxy downsizing; and a correlation between formation timescale and \$\{$\backslash$rm sSFR\}(M\_*,t)\$ similar to recent results from simulations that provides a natural connection to bulge growth. We take these surprising findings -- which ultimately imply that quenching is the "peeling-off" of the densest tail of the starforming population at any epoch -- to mean either that: (1) models in which galaxies are diversified on long timescales by something akin to initial conditions rival the dominant "grow-and-quench" framework as good descriptions of the data; or (2) cornerstone metrics of galaxy evolution are too information-poor -- if not intrinsically misleading -- to confirm a unique explanation. We outline future tests of our model but stress that, even if it is shown to be incorrect, it illustrates how exploring different evolutionary paradigms can aid learning and, we hope, more detailed modeling efforts.},

  title = {How {{To Model Supernovae}} in {{Simulations}} of {{Star}} and {{Galaxy Formation}}},
  abstract = {We study the implementation of mechanical feedback from supernovae (SNe) and stellar mass loss in galaxy simulations, within the Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE) project. We present the FIRE-2 algorithm for coupling mechanical feedback, which can be applied to any hydrodynamics method (e.g. fixed-grid, moving-mesh, and mesh-less methods), and black hole as well as stellar feedback. This algorithm ensures manifest conservation of mass, energy, and momentum, and avoids imprinting 'preferred directions' on the ejecta. We show that it is critical to incorporate both momentum and thermal energy of mechanical ejecta in a self-consistent manner, accounting for SNe cooling radii when they are not resolved. Using idealized simulations of single SNe explosions, we show that the FIRE-2 algorithm, independent of resolution, reproduces converged solutions in both energy and momentum. In contrast, common 'fully-thermal' (energy-dump) or 'fully-kinetic' (particle-kicking) schemes in the literature depend strongly on resolution: when applied at mass resolution \$$\backslash$gtrsim 100$\backslash$,M\_\{$\backslash$odot\}\$, they diverge by orders-of-magnitude from the converged solution. In galaxy-formation simulations, this divergence leads to orders-of-magnitude differences in galaxy properties, unless those models are adjusted in a resolution-dependent way. We show that all models that individually time-resolve SNe converge to the FIRE-2 solution at sufficiently high resolution (\$$<$100$\backslash$,M\_\{$\backslash$odot\}\$). However, in both idealized single-SNe simulations and cosmological galaxy-formation simulations, the FIRE-2 algorithm converges much faster than other sub-grid models without re-tuning parameters.},

  shorttitle = {Accelerating {{Approximate Bayesian Computation}} with {{Quantile Regression}}},
  abstract = {Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) is a method to obtain a posterior distribution without a likelihood function, using simulations and a set of distance metrics. For that reason, it has recently been gaining popularity as an analysis tool in cosmology and astrophysics. Its drawback, however, is a slow convergence rate. We propose a novel method, which we call qABC, to accelerate ABC with Quantile Regression. In this method, we create a model of quantiles of distance measure as a function of input parameters. This model is trained on a small number of simulations and estimates which regions of the prior space are likely to be accepted into the posterior. Other regions are then immediately rejected. This procedure is then repeated as more simulations are available. We apply it to the practical problem of estimation of redshift distribution of cosmological samples, using forward modelling developed in previous work. The qABC method converges to nearly same posterior as the basic ABC. It uses, however, only 20$\backslash$\% of the number of simulations compared to basic ABC, achieving a fivefold gain in execution time for our problem. For other problems the acceleration rate may vary; it depends on how close the prior is to the final posterior. We discuss possible improvements and extensions to this method.},

Calibration of the fibre throughputs, fluxes and differential-atmospheric-refraction has been improved over the Early Data Release. The data have average spatial resolution of 2.16 arcsec (FWHM) over the 15\textasciitilde{}arcsec diameter field of view and spectral (kinematic) resolution R=4263 (sigma=30km/s) around Halpha. The relative flux calibration is better than 5$\backslash$\% and absolute flux calibration better than \$$\backslash$pm0.22\$\textasciitilde{}mag, with the latter estimate limited by galaxy photometry.

  title = {Galaxy {{And Mass Assembly}} ({{GAMA}}): {{The}} Mechanisms for Quiescent Galaxy Formation at \$z$<$1\$},
  shorttitle = {Galaxy {{And Mass Assembly}} ({{GAMA}})},
  abstract = {One key problem in astrophysics is understanding how and why galaxies switch off their star formation, building the quiescent population that we observe in the local Universe. From the GAMA and VIPERS surveys, we use spectroscopic indices to select quiescent and candidate transition galaxies. We identify potentially rapidly transitioning post-starburst galaxies, and slower transitioning green-valley galaxies. Over the last 8 Gyrs the quiescent population has grown more slowly in number density at high masses (M\$\_*$>$10\^\{11\}\$M\$\_$\backslash$odot\$) than at intermediate masses (M\$\_*$>$10\^\{10.6\}\$M\$\_$\backslash$odot\$). There is evolution in both the post-starburst and green valley stellar mass functions, consistent with higher mass galaxies quenching at earlier cosmic times. At intermediate masses (M\$\_*$>$10\^\{10.6\}\$M\$\_$\backslash$odot\$) we find a green valley transition timescale of 2.6 Gyr. Alternatively, at \$z$\backslash$sim0.7\$ the entire growth rate could be explained by fast-quenching post-starburst galaxies, with a visibility timescale of 0.5 Gyr. At lower redshift, the number density of post-starbursts is so low that an unphysically short visibility window would be required for them to contribute significantly to the quiescent population growth. The importance of the fast-quenching route may rapidly diminish at \$z$<$1\$. However, at high masses (M\$\_*$>$10\^\{11\}\$M\$\_$\backslash$odot\$), there is tension between the large number of candidate transition galaxies compared to the slow growth of the quiescent population. This could be resolved if not all high mass post-starburst and green-valley galaxies are transitioning from star-forming to quiescent, for example if they rejuvenate out of the quiescent population following the accretion of gas and triggering of star formation, or if they fail to completely quench their star formation.},

  abstract = {We present the first study of the evolution of the galaxy luminosity and stellar-mass functions (GLF and GSMF) carried out by the Dark Energy Survey (DES). We describe the COMMODORE galaxy catalogue selected from Science Verification images. This catalogue is made of \$$\backslash$sim 4$\backslash$times 10\^\{6\}\$ galaxies at \$0$<$z$\backslash$lesssim1.3\$ over a sky area of \$$\backslash$sim155$\backslash$ \{$\backslash$rm sq. $\backslash$ deg\}\$ with \$\{$\backslash$it i\}\$-band limiting magnitude \$\{$\backslash$it i\}=23$\backslash$ \{$\backslash$rm mag\}\$. Such characteristics are unprecedented for galaxy catalogues and they enable us to study the evolution of GLF and GSMF at \$0$<$z$<$1\$ homogeneously with the same statistically-rich data-set and free of cosmic variance effects. The aim of this study is twofold: i) we want to test our method based on the use of photometric-redshift probability density functions against literature results obtained with spectroscopic redshifts; ii) we want to shed light on the way galaxies build up their masses over cosmic time. We find that both the \$\{$\backslash$it i\}\$-band galaxy luminosity and stellar mass functions are characterised by a double-Schechter shape at \$z$<$0.2\$. Both functions agree well with those based on spectroscopic redshifts. The DES GSMF agrees especially with those measured for the GAlaxy Mass Assembly and the PRism MUlti-object Survey out to \$z$\backslash$sim1\$. At \$0.2$<$z$<$1\$, we find the \$\{$\backslash$it i\}\$-band luminosity and stellar-mass densities respectively to be constant (\$$\backslash$rho\_\{$\backslash$rm L\}$\backslash$propto (1+z)\^\{-0.12$\backslash$pm0.11\}\$) and decreasing (\$$\backslash$rho\_\{$\backslash$rm Mstar\}$\backslash$propto (1+z)\^\{-0.5$\backslash$pm0.1\}\$) with \$z\$. This indicates that, while at higher redshift galaxies have less stellar mass, their luminosities do not change substantially because of their younger and brighter stellar populations. Finally, we also find evidence for a top-down mass-dependent evolution of the GSMF.},

  shorttitle = {{{ELUCID IV}}},
  abstract = {We examine the quenched fraction of central and satellite galaxies as a function of galaxy stellar mass, halo mass, and the matter density of their large scale environment. Matter densities are inferred from our ELUCID simulation, a constrained simulation of the local Universe, sampled by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), while halo masses and the distinction between centrals and satellites are taken from the SDSS galaxy group catalog. The quenched fraction for the total population increases systematically with stellar mass, halo mass, and environmental density. In agreement with previous studies, we find that the ‘environmental quenching efficiency', which quantifies the quenched fraction as function of environmental density, is independent of stellar mass. This independence also holds when using halo mass as the environmental parameter. And the stellar mass independence of density-based efficiency originates from the independence of halo-based efficiency. We find that centrals and satellites follow similar correlations of quenching efficiency with halo mass and stellar mass, suggesting that they have experienced similar quenching processes. When using mass density as environmental parameter, though, the environmental dependence is much stronger for satellites than for centrals, and the quenching efficiencies of the two populations reveal a significant residual dependence on stellar mass. These are predominantly determined by the fact that centrals and satellites of the same stellar mass on average live in halos of different masses. After removing these halo-mass effects, there is a weak but significant residual in the quenched fraction of central galaxies, which is eliminated when halo assembly bias is taken into account. Our results therefore indicate that halo mass is the prime environmental parameter that regulates the quenching of both centrals and satellites.},

We use the shape of the BOSS redshift-space galaxy power spectrum, in combination with CMB and supernova data, to constrain the neutrino masses and the dark energy. Essential to this calculation are several recent advances in non-linear cosmological perturbation theory, including FFT methods, redshift space distortions, and scale-dependent growth. Our 95\% confidence upper bound of 200 meV on the sum of masses degrades substantially to 770 meV when the dark energy equation of state and its first derivative are also allowed to vary, representing a significant challenge to current constraints. We also study the impact of additional galaxy bias parameters, finding that a velocity bias or a more complicated scale-dependent density bias shift the preferred neutrino mass values 20\%-30\% lower while minimally impacting the other cosmological parameters.},

  title = {Extending the Modeling of the Anisotropic Galaxy Power Spectrum to \$k = 0.4 $\backslash$ H$\backslash$mathrm\{\vphantom\}{{Mpc}}\vphantom\{\}\^\{-1\}\$},
  abstract = {We present a new model for the redshift-space power spectrum of galaxies and demonstrate its accuracy in modeling the monopole, quadrupole, and hexadecapole of the galaxy density field down to scales of \$k = 0.4 $\backslash$ h$\backslash$mathrm\{Mpc\}\^\{-1\}\$. The model describes the clustering of galaxies in the context of a halo model and the clustering of the underlying halos in redshift space using a combination of Eulerian perturbation theory and \$N\$-body simulations. The modeling of redshift-space distortions is done using the so-called distribution function approach. The final model has 13 free parameters, and each parameter is physically motivated rather than a nuisance parameter, which allows the use of well-motivated priors. We account for the Finger-of-God effect from centrals and both isolated and non-isolated satellites rather than using a single velocity dispersion to describe the combined effect. We test and validate the accuracy of the model on several sets of high-fidelity \$N\$-body simulations, as well as realistic mock catalogs designed to simulate the BOSS DR12 CMASS data set. The suite of simulations covers a range of cosmologies and galaxy bias models, providing a rigorous test of the level of theoretical systematics present in the model. The level of bias in the recovered values of \$f $\backslash$sigma\_8\$ is found to be small. When including scales to \$k = 0.4 $\backslash$ h$\backslash$mathrm\{Mpc\}\^\{-1\}\$, we find 15-30$\backslash$\% gains in the statistical precision of \$f $\backslash$sigma\_8\$ relative to \$k = 0.2 $\backslash$ h$\backslash$mathrm\{Mpc\}\^\{-1\}\$ and a roughly 10-15$\backslash$\% improvement for the perpendicular Alcock-Paczynski parameter \$$\backslash$alpha\_$\backslash$perp\$. Using the BOSS DR12 CMASS mocks as a benchmark for comparison, we estimate an uncertainty on \$f $\backslash$sigma\_8\$ that is \$$\backslash$sim\$10-20$\backslash$\% larger than other similar Fourier-space RSD models in the literature that use \$k $\backslash$leq 0.2 $\backslash$ h$\backslash$mathrm\{Mpc\}\^\{-1\}\$, suggesting that these models likely have a too-limited parametrization.},

  title = {Imprints of {{Reionization}} in {{Galaxy Clustering}}},
  abstract = {Reionization, the only phase transition in the Universe since recombination, is a key event in the cosmic history of baryonic matter. We derive, in the context of the large-scale bias expansion, the imprints of the epoch of reionization in the large-scale distribution of galaxies, and identify two contributions of particular importance. First, the Compton scattering of CMB photons off the free electrons lead to a drag force on the baryon fluid. This drag induces a relative velocity between baryons and CDM which is of the same order of magnitude as the primordially-induced relative velocity, and enters in the evolution of the relative velocity as calculated by Boltzmann codes. This leads to a unique contribution to galaxy bias involving the matter velocity squared. The second important effect is a modulation of the galaxy density by the ionizing radiation field through radiative transfer effects, which is captured in the bias expansion by so-called higher-derivative terms. We constrain both of these imprints using the power spectrum of the BOSS DR12 galaxy sample. While they do not lead to a shift in the baryon acoustic oscillation scale, including these terms is important for unbiased cosmology constraints from the shape of the galaxy power spectrum.},

  title = {Towards Optimal Extraction of Cosmological Information from Nonlinear Data},
  abstract = {One of the main unsolved problems of cosmology is how to maximize the extraction of information from nonlinear data. If the data are nonlinear the usual approach is to employ a sequence of statistics (N-point statistics, counting statistics of clusters, density peaks or voids etc.), along with the corresponding covariance matrices. However, this approach is computationally prohibitive and has not been shown to be exhaustive in terms of information content. Here we instead develop a Bayesian approach, expanding the likelihood around the maximum posterior of linear modes, which we solve for using optimization methods. By integrating out the modes using perturbative expansion of the likelihood we construct an initial power spectrum estimator, which for a fixed forward model contains all the cosmological information if the initial modes are gaussian distributed. We develop a method to construct the window and covariance matrix such that the estimator is explicitly unbiased and nearly optimal. We then generalize the method to include the forward model parameters, including cosmological and nuisance parameters, and primordial non-gaussianity. We apply the method in the simplified context of nonlinear structure formation, using either simplified 2-LPT dynamics or N-body simulations as the nonlinear mapping between linear and nonlinear density, and 2-LPT dynamics in the optimization steps used to reconstruct the initial density modes. We demonstrate that the method gives an unbiased estimator of the initial power spectrum, providing among other a near optimal reconstruction of linear baryonic acoustic oscillations.},

  title = {The Imprint of Neutrinos on Clustering in Redshift-Space},
  abstract = {(abridged) We investigate the signatures left by the cosmic neutrino background on the clustering of matter, CDM+baryons and halos in redshift-space using a set of more than 1000 N-body and hydrodynamical simulations with massless and massive neutrinos. We find that the effect neutrinos induce on the clustering of CDM+baryons in redshift-space on small scales is almost entirely due to the change in \$$\backslash$sigma\_8\$. Neutrinos imprint a characteristic signature in the quadrupole of the matter (CDM+baryons+neutrinos) field on small scales, that can be used to disentangle the effect of \$$\backslash$sigma\_8\$ and \$M\_$\backslash$nu\$. We show that the effect of neutrinos on the clustering of halos is very different, on all scales, to the one induced by \$$\backslash$sigma\_8\$. We find that the effects of neutrinos of the growth rate of CDM+baryons ranges from \$$\backslash$sim0.3$\backslash$\%\$ to \$2$\backslash$\%\$ on scales \$k$\backslash$in[0.01, 0.5]\textasciitilde{}h\{$\backslash$rm Mpc\}\^\{-1\}\$ for neutrinos with masses \$M\_$\backslash$nu $\backslash$leqslant 0.15\$ eV. We compute the bias between the momentum of halos and the momentum of CDM+baryon and find it to be 1 on large scales for all models with massless and massive neutrinos considered. This point towards a velocity bias between halos and total matter on large scales that it is important to account for in order to extract unbiased neutrino information from velocity/momentum surveys such as kSZ observations. We show that baryonic effects can affect the clustering of matter and CDM+baryons in redshift-space by up to a few percent down to \$k=0.5\textasciitilde{}h\{$\backslash$rm Mpc\}\^\{-1\}\$. We find that hydrodynamics and astrophysical processes, as implemented in our simulations, only distort the relative effect that neutrinos induce on the anisotropic clustering of matter, CDM+baryons and halos in redshift-space by less than \$1$\backslash$\%\$. Thus, the effect of neutrinos in the fully non-linear regime can be written as a transfer function with very weak dependence on astrophysics.},

  abstract = {We use stellar mass functions to study the properties and the significance of quenching through major galaxy mergers. In addition to SDSS DR7 and Galaxy Zoo 1 data, we use samples of visually selected major galaxy mergers and post merger galaxies. We determine the stellar mass functions of the stages that we would expect major merger quenched galaxies to pass through on their way from the blue cloud to the red sequence: 1: major merger, 2: post merger, 3: blue early type, 4: green early type and 5: red early type. Based on the similar mass function shapes we conclude that major mergers are likely to form an evolutionary sequence from star formation to quiescence via quenching. Relative to all blue galaxies, the major merger fraction increases as a function of stellar mass. Major merger quenching is inconsistent with the mass and environment quenching model. At z\textasciitilde{}0 major merger quenched galaxies are unlikely to constitute the majority of galaxies that transition the green valley. Furthermore, between z\textasciitilde{}0-0.5 major merger quenched galaxies account for 1-5\% of all quenched galaxies at a given stellar mass. Major galaxy mergers are therefore not a significant quenching pathway, neither at z\textasciitilde{}0 nor within the last 5 Gyr. The majority of red galaxies must have been quenched through an alternative quenching mechanism which causes a slow blue to red evolution.},

  abstract = {Over the next decade, improvements in cosmological parameter constraints will be driven by surveys of large-scale structure. Its inherent non-linearity suggests that significant information will be embedded in higher correlations beyond the two-point function. Extracting this information is extremely challenging: it requires accurate theoretical modelling and significant computational resources to estimate the covariance matrix describing correlations between different Fourier configurations. We investigate whether it is possible to reduce the covariance matrix without significant loss of information by using a proxy that aggregates the bispectrum over a subset of Fourier configurations. Specifically, we study the constraints on \$$\backslash$Lambda\$CDM parameters from combining the power spectrum with (a) the modal bispectrum decomposition, (b) the line correlation function and (c) the integrated bispectrum. We forecast the error bars achievable on \$$\backslash$Lambda\$CDM parameters using these proxies in a future galaxy survey and compare them to those obtained from measurements of the Fourier bispectrum, including simple estimates of their degradation in the presence of shot noise. Our results demonstrate that the modal bispectrum performs as well as the Fourier bispectrum, even with considerably fewer modes than Fourier configurations. The line correlation function has good performance but does not match the modal bispectrum. The integrated bispectrum is comparatively insensitive to changes in the background cosmology. We find that adding bispectrum data can improve constraints on bias parameters and the normalization \$$\backslash$sigma\_8\$ by up to 5 compared to power spectrum measurements alone. For other parameters, improvements of up to \$$\backslash$sim\$ 20\% are possible. Finally, we use a range of theoretical models to explore how the sophistication required for realistic predictions varies with each proxy. (abridged)},

Observations indicate that the z = 0 stellar mass-halo mass (SMHM) relation has remarkably small scatter in stellar mass at fixed halo mass ($\lessequivlnt$0.2 dex), with little dependence on halo mass. We investigate the origins of this scatter by combining N-body simulations with observational
constraints on the SMHM relation. We find that at the group and cluster scale (\{M\}\{vir\}$\backslash$gt \{10\}14 \{M\}$\odot$ ) the scatter due purely to hierarchical assembly is $\approx$ 0.16 dex, which is comparable to recent direct observational estimates. At lower masses, mass buildup since z$\approx$ 2 is driven largely by in situ growth. We
include a model for the in situ buildup of stellar mass and find that an intrinsic scatter in this growth channel of 0.2 dex produces a relation between scatter and halo mass that is consistent with observations from \{10\}12 \{M\}$\odot$ $\backslash$lt \{M\}\{vir\}$\backslash$lt
\{10\}14.75 \{M\}$\odot$ . The approximately constant scatter across a wide range of halo masses at z = 0 thus appears to be a coincidence, as it is determined largely by in situ growth at low masses and by hierarchical assembly at high masses. These results indicate that the scatter in the SMHM relation can provide unique insight into the regularity of the galaxy formation process.},

  abstract = {Gladders et al. have recently suggested that the star formation histories (SFHs) of individual galaxies are characterized by a
log-normal function in time, implying a slow decline rather than rapid quenching. We test their conjecture on theoretical SFHs from the cosmological simulation Illustris and on observationally inferred SFHs. While the log-normal form necessarily ignores short-lived features such as starbursts, it fits the overall shape of the majority of SFHs very well. In particular, 85\% of the cumulative SFHs are fitted to within a maximum error of 5\% of the total stellar mass formed, and 99\% to within 10\%. The log-normal performs systematically better than the commonly used delayed-$\tau$ model, and is superseded only by functions with more than three free parameters. Poor fits are mostly found in galaxies that were rapidly quenched after becoming satellites. We explore the
log-normal parameter space of normalization, peak time, and full width at half maximum, and find that the simulated and observed samples occupy similar regions, though Illustris predicts wider, later-forming SFHs on average. The ensemble of log-normal fits correctly reproduces complex metrics such as the evolution of Illustris galaxies across the star formation main sequence, but overpredicts their quenching timescales. SFHs in Illustris are a diverse population not determined by any one physical property of galaxies, but follow a tight relation, where \{width\} $\backslash$propto \{(\{peak\}\{time\})\}3/2. We show that such a relation can be explained qualitatively (though not quantitatively) by a close connection between the growth of dark matter halos and their galaxies.},

In addition, we present a compilation of UV, IR and H\$$\backslash$alpha\$ SFRFs and compare these with the predictions from the EAGLE suite of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. We find that the constraints implied by different indicators are inconsistent with each other for the highest star-forming objects at z $<$ 2, a problem that is possibly related to selection biases and the uncertainties of dust attenuation effects. EAGLE's feedback parameters were calibrated to reproduce realistic galaxy sizes and stellar masses at z = 0.1. In this work we test if and why those choices yield realistic Star Formation Rates (SFRs) for \$z $\backslash$sim 0-8\$ as well. We demonstrate that SNe feedback plays a major role at setting the abundance of galaxies at all star-forming regimes, especially at high redshifts. On the contrary, Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) feedback becomes more prominent at lower redshifts and is a major mechanism that affects only the highest star-forming systems. Furthermore, we find that galaxies with SFR \$$\backslash$sim 1-10 $\backslash$, \{$\backslash$rm M\_\{$\backslash$odot\} $\backslash$, yr\^\{-1\}\}\$ dominate the CSFRD at redshifts z $<$ 5, while rare high star-forming galaxies (SFR \$$\backslash$sim 10-100 $\backslash$,\{$\backslash$rm M\_\{$\backslash$odot\} $\backslash$, yr\^\{-1\}\}\$) contribute significantly only briefly around the peak era (\$z $\backslash$sim 2\$) and then are quenched by AGN feedback. In the absence of this prescription objects with SFR \$$\backslash$sim 10-100 $\backslash$,\{$\backslash$rm M\_\{$\backslash$odot\} $\backslash$, yr\^\{-1\}\}\$ would dominate the CSFRD, while the cosmic budget of star formation would be extremely high.

Here we provide an overview of the underlying theory and discuss five natural whitening procedures. Subsequently, we demonstrate that investigating the cross-covariance and the cross-correlation matrix between sphered and original variables allows to break the rotational invariance and to identify optimal whitening transformations. As a result we recommend two particular approaches: ZCA-cor whitening to produce sphered variables that are maximally similar to the original variables, and PCA-cor whitening to obtain sphered variables that maximally compress the original variables.},

In contrast, Keplerian Doppler shifts affect every spectral line in the same way. With high enough S/N and high enough resolution, statistical techniques can exploit differences in spectra to disentangle the photospheric velocities and detect lower-amplitude exoplanet signals.

  abstract = {Motivated by recent developments in perturbative calculations of the nonlinear evolution of large-scale structure, we present an iterative algorithm to reconstruct the initial conditions in a given volume starting from the dark matter distribution in real space. In our algorithm, objects are first moved back iteratively along estimated potential gradients, with a progressively reduced smoothing scale, until a nearly uniform catalog is obtained. The linear initial density is then estimated as the divergence of the cumulative displacement, with an optional second-order correction. This algorithm should undo nonlinear effects up to one-loop order, including the higher-order infrared resummation piece. We test the method using dark matter simulations in real space. At redshift \$z=0\$, we find that after eight iterations the reconstructed density is more than \$95$\backslash$\%\$ correlated with the initial density at \$k$\backslash$le 0.35$\backslash$; h$\backslash$mathrm\{Mpc\}\^\{-1\}\$. The reconstruction also reduces the power in the difference between reconstructed and initial fields by more than 2 orders of magnitude at \$k$\backslash$le 0.2$\backslash$; h$\backslash$mathrm\{Mpc\}\^\{-1\}\$, and it extends the range of scales where the full broadband shape of the power spectrum matches linear theory by a factor of 2-3. As a specific application, we consider measurements of the baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) scale that can be improved by reducing the degradation effects of large-scale flows. In our idealized dark matter simulations, the method improves the BAO signal-to-noise ratio by a factor of 2.7 at \$z=0\$ and by a factor of 2.5 at \$z=0.6\$, improving standard BAO reconstruction by \$70$\backslash$\%\$ at \$z=0\$ and \$30$\backslash$\%\$ at \$z=0.6\$, and matching the optimal BAO signal and signal-to-noise ratio of the linear density in the same volume. For BAO, the iterative nature of the reconstruction is the most important aspect.},

Their impact on the formation of large scale structure can be used to determine their absolute mass scale from cosmology, but to this end accurate numerical simulations have to be developed. Due to their relativistic nature, neutrinos pose additional challenges when one tries to include them in N-body simulations that are traditionally based on Newtonian physics. Here we present the first numerical study of massive neutrinos that uses a fully relativistic approach. Our N-body code, gevolution, is based on a weak-field formulation of general relativity that naturally provides a self-consistent framework for relativistic particle species. This allows us to model neutrinos from first principles, without invoking any ad-hoc recipes. Our simulation suite comprises some of the largest neutrino simulations performed to date. We study the effect of massive neutrinos on the nonlinear power spectra and the halo mass function, focusing on the interesting mass range between 0.06 eV and 0.3 eV and including a case for an inverted mass hierarchy.},

Walker and Pe$\backslash$\textasciitilde\{n\}arrubia have used this approach to argue that data for these galaxies are consistent with constant-density ‘cores' in their inner regions and rule out ‘cuspy' Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profiles with high statistical significance, particularly in the case of Sculptor. We test the validity of these claims using dwarf galaxies in the APOSTLE \$$\backslash$Lambda\$CDM cosmological hydrodynamics simulations of analogues of the Local Group. These galaxies all have NFW dark matter density profiles and a subset of them develop two distinct metallicity subpopulations reminiscent of Sculptor and Fornax. We apply a method analogous to that of Walker and Penarrubia to a sample of 53 simulated dwarfs and find that this procedure often leads to a statistically significant detection of a core in the profile when in reality there is a cusp. Although multiple factors contribute to these failures, the main cause is a violation of the assumption of spherical symmetry upon which the mass estimators are based. The stellar populations of the simulated dwarfs tend to be significantly elongated and, in several cases, the two metallicity populations have different asphericity and are misaligned. As a result, a wide range of slopes of the density profile are inferred depending on the angle from which the galaxy is viewed.},

  title = {On Stellar Mass Loss from Galaxies in Groups and Clusters},
  abstract = {We estimate the stellar mass that satellite galaxies lose once they enter groups (and clusters) by identifying groups in a high-resolution cosmological N-body simulation, assigning entry masses to satellite galaxies with halo abundance matching at the entry time, and comparing the predicted conditional stellar mass function of satellite galaxies at \$z$\backslash$simeq0\$ with observations. Our results depend on the mass of the stars that form in satellite galaxies after the entry time. A model in which star formation shuts down completely as soon a galaxy enters a group environment is ruled out because it underpredicts the stellar masses of satellite galaxies even in the absence of tidal stripping. The greater is the stellar mass that is allowed to form, the greater the fraction that needs to be tidally stripped. The stellar mass fraction lost by satellite galaxies after entering a group or cluster environment is consistent with any value in the range \$0-40$\backslash$\%\$. To place stronger constraints, we consider a more refined model of tidal stripping of galaxies on elongated orbits (where stripping occurs at orbit pericentres). Our model predicts less tidal stripping: satellite galaxies lose \$$\backslash$sim 20-25$\backslash$\%\$ of their stellar mass since their entry into the group. This finding is consistent with a slow-starvation delayed-quenching picture, in which galaxies that enter a group or cluster environment keep forming stars until at least the first pericentric passage.},

  title = {Cosmic Shear Calibration with Forward Modeling},
  abstract = {Weak Gravitational Lensing is a powerful probe of the dark sector of the Universe. One of the main challenges for this technique is the treatment of systematics in the measurement of cosmic shear from galaxy shapes. In an earlier work, Refregier \& Amara (2014) have proposed the Monte Carlo Control Loops (MCCL) to overcome these effects using a forward modeling approach. We focus here on one of the control loops in this method, the task of which is the calibration of the shear measurement. For this purpose, we first consider the requirements on the shear systematics for a given survey and propagate them to different systematics terms. We use two one-point statistics to calibrate the shear measurement and six further one-point statistics as diagnostics. We also propagate the systematics levels that we estimate from the one-point functions to the two-point functions for the different systematic error sources. This allows us to assess the consistency between the systematics levels measured in different ways. To test the method, we construct synthetic sky surveys with an area of 1,700 deg\$\^2\$. With some simplifying assumptions, we are able to meet the requirements on the shear calibration for this survey configuration. Furthermore, we account for the total residual shear systematics in terms of the contributing sources. We discuss how this MCCL framework can be applied to current and future weak lensing surveys.},

  title = {What Sets the Central Structure of Dark Matter Haloes?},
  abstract = {Dark matter (DM) haloes forming near the thermal cut-off scale of the density perturbations are unique, since they are the smallest objects and form through monolithic gravitational collapse, while larger haloes contrastingly have experienced mergers. While standard cold dark matter simulations readily produce haloes that follow the universal Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) density profile with an inner slope, \$$\backslash$rho $\backslash$propto r\^\{-$\backslash$alpha\}\$, with \$$\backslash$alpha=1\$, recent simulations have found that when the free-streaming cut-off is resolved, the resulting haloes follow nearly power-law density profiles of \$$\backslash$alpha$\backslash$sim1.5\$. In this paper, we study the formation of density cusps in haloes using idealized \$N\$-body simulations of the collapse of proto-haloes. When the proto-halo profile is initially cored due to particle free-streaming at high redshift, we universally find \$$\backslash$sim r\^\{-1.5\}\$ profiles irrespective of the proto-halo profile slope outside the core and large-scale non-spherical perturbations. Quite in contrast, when the proto-halo has a power-law profile, then we obtain profiles compatible with the NFW shape when the density slope of the proto-halo patch is shallower than a critical value, \$$\backslash$alpha\_\{$\backslash$rm ini\} $\backslash$sim 0.3\$, while the final slope can be steeper for \$$\backslash$alpha\_\{$\backslash$rm ini\}$\backslash$gtrsim 0.3\$. We further demonstrate that the \$r\^\{-1.5\}\$ profiles are sensitive to small scale noise, which gradually drives them towards an inner slope of \$-1\$, where they become resilient to such perturbations. We demonstrate that the \$r\^\{-1.5\}\$ solutions are in hydrostatic equilibrium, largely consistent with a simple analytic model, and provide arguments that angular momentum appears to determine the inner slope.},

  abstract = {We measure the clustering of DES Year 1 galaxies that are intended to be combined with weak lensing samples in order to produce precise cosmological constraints from the joint analysis of large-scale structure and lensing correlations. Two-point correlation functions are measured for a sample of \$6.6 $\backslash$times 10\^\{5\}\$ luminous red galaxies selected using the $\backslash$textsc\{redMaGiC\} algorithm over an area of \$1321\$ square degrees, in the redshift range \$0.15 $<$ z $<$ 0.9\$, split into five tomographic redshift bins. The sample has a mean redshift uncertainty of \$$\backslash$sigma\_\{z\}/(1+z) = 0.017\$. We quantify and correct spurious correlations induced by spatially variable survey properties, testing their impact on the clustering measurements and covariance. We demonstrate the sample's robustness by testing for stellar contamination, for potential biases that could arise from the systematic correction, and for the consistency between the two-point auto- and cross-correlation functions. We show that the corrections we apply have a significant impact on the resultant measurement of cosmological parameters, but that the results are robust against arbitrary choices in the correction method. We find the linear galaxy bias in each redshift bin in a fiducial cosmology to be \$b(z\$=\$0.24)=1.40 $\backslash$pm 0.08\$, \$b(z\$=\$0.38)=1.61 $\backslash$pm 0.05\$, \$b(z\$=\$0.53)=1.60 $\backslash$pm 0.04\$ for galaxies with luminosities \$L/L\_*$>$\$\$0.5\$, \$b(z\$=\$0.68)=1.93 $\backslash$pm 0.05\$ for \$L/L\_*$>$\$\$1\$ and \$b(z\$=\$0.83)=1.99 $\backslash$pm 0.07\$ for \$L/L\_*\$\$$>$1.5\$, broadly consistent with expectations for the redshift and luminosity dependence of the bias of red galaxies.

We find that the baryonic processes have almost no impact on large-scale structures -- at least not when classified using aforementioned techniques. More importantly, our results confirm that the gas component alone can be used to infer the filamentary structure of the Universe practically un-biased, which could be applied to cosmology constrains. In addition, the gas filaments are classified with its velocity and density fields, which can theoretically connect to the radio observations, such as HI surveys. This will help us to bias-freely link the radio observations with dark matter distributions at large scale.},

Non-Gaussian contributions to the model are calibrated against mock catalogs, after which the model covariance is found to be in impressive agreement with the mock covariance matrix. Since calibration of this method requires fewer mocks than brute force approaches, we believe that it could dramatically reduce the number of mocks required to analyse future surveys.},

  abstract = {We measure how the properties of star-forming central galaxies correlate with large-scale environment, \$$\backslash$delta\$, measured on \$10\$Mpc/h scales. We use group catalogs to isolate a robust sample of central galaxies with high purity and completeness. The properties we investigate are star formation rate (SFR), exponential disk scale length \$R\_\{$\backslash$rm exp\}\$, and Sersic index of the light profile, \$n\$. We find that, at all stellar masses, there is an inverse correlation between SFR and \$$\backslash$delta\$, meaning that above-average star forming centrals live in underdense regions. For \$n\$ and \$R\_\{$\backslash$rm exp\}\$, there is no correlation with \$$\backslash$delta\$ at \$M\_\{$\backslash$rm star\}$\backslash$lesssim 10\^\{10.5\}\$ \$M\_$\backslash$odot\$, but at higher masses there are positive correlations; a weak correlation with \$R\_\{$\backslash$rm exp\}\$ and a strong correlation with \$n\$. These data are evidence of assembly bias within the star-forming population. The results for SFR are consistent with a model in which SFR correlates with present-day halo accretion rate, \$$\backslash$dot\{M\}\_h\$. In this model, galaxies are assigned to halos using the abundance matching ansatz, which maps galaxy stellar mass onto halo mass. At fixed halo mass, SFR is assigned to galaxies using the same approach,but \$$\backslash$dot\{M\}\_h\$ is used to map onto SFR. The best-fit model requires some scatter in the \$$\backslash$dot\{M\}\_h\$-SFR relation. The \$R\_\{$\backslash$rm exp\}\$ and \$n\$ measurements are consistent with a model in which these quantities are correlated with the spin parameter of the halo, \$$\backslash$lambda\$. Halo spin does not correlate with \$$\backslash$delta\$ at low halo masses, but for higher mass halos, high-spin halos live in higher density environments at fixed \$M\_h\$. Put together with the earlier installments of this series, these data demonstrate that quenching processes have limited correlation with halo formation history, but the growth of active galaxies, as well as other detailed properties, are influenced by the details of halo assembly.},

  shorttitle = {Accurate {{Modelling}} of {{Galaxy Clustering}} on {{Small Scales}}},
  abstract = {Interpreting the small-scale clustering of galaxies with halo models can elucidate the connection between galaxies and dark matter halos. Unfortunately, the modelling is typically not sufficiently accurate for ruling out models in a statistical sense. It is thus difficult to use the information encoded in small scales to test cosmological models or probe subtle features of the galaxy-halo connection. In this paper, we attempt to push halo modelling into the "accurate" regime with a fully numerical mock-based methodology and careful treatment of statistical and systematic errors. An advantage of this approach is that it can easily incorporate clustering statistics beyond the traditional two-point statistics. We use this modelling methodology to test the standard \$$\backslash$Lambda$\backslash$mathrm\{CDM\}\$ + halo model against the clustering of SDSS DR7 galaxies. Specifically, we use the projected correlation function, group multiplicity function and galaxy number density as constraints. We find that while the model provides a good match to each statistic separately, it struggles to fit them jointly. Adding group statistics leads to a more stringent test of the model and significantly tighter constraints on model parameters. We explore the impact of varying the adopted halo definition and cosmological model and find that changing the cosmology makes a significant difference. The most successful model we tried (Planck cosmology with Mvir halos) matches the clustering of low luminosity galaxies, but exhibits a \$2.3 $\backslash$sigma\$ tension with the clustering of luminous galaxies, thus providing evidence that the "standard" halo model needs to be extended. This work represents the most accurate modelling of small-scale clustering to-date and opens the door to adding interesting freedom to the halo model and including additional clustering statistics as constraints.},

  abstract = {In order to best improve constraints on cosmological parameters and on models of modified gravity using current and future galaxy surveys it is necessary maximally exploit the available data. As redshift-space distortions mean statistical translation invariance is broken for galaxy observations, this will require measurement of the monopole, quadrupole and hexadecapole of not just the galaxy power spectrum, but also the galaxy bispectrum. A recent (2015) paper by Scoccimarro demonstrated how the standard bispectrum estimator may be expressed in terms of Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs) to afford an extremely efficient algorithm, allowing the bispectrum multipoles on all scales and triangle shapes to be measured in comparable time to those of the power spectrum. In this paper we present a suite of alternative proxies to measure the three-point correlation multipoles. In particular, we describe a modal (or plane wave) decomposition to capture the information in each multipole in a series of basis coefficients, and also describe three compressed estimators formed using the skew-spectrum, the line correlation function and the integrated bispectrum, respectively. As well as each of the estimators offering a different measurement channel, and thereby a robustness check, it is expected that some (especially the modal estimator) will offer a vast data compression, and so a much reduced covariance matrix. This compression may be vital to reduce the computational load involved in extracting the available three-point information.},

  abstract = {Emission line galaxies (ELGs) are used in several ongoing and upcoming surveys as tracers of the dark matter distribution. Using a new galaxy formation model, we explore the characteristics of [OII] emitters, which dominate optical ELG selections at \$z$\backslash$simeq 1\$. Model [OII] emitters at \$0.5$<$z$<$1.5\$ are selected to mimic the DEEP2, VVDS, eBOSS and DESI surveys. The luminosity functions of model [OII] emitters are in reasonable agreement with observations. The selected [OII] emitters are hosted by haloes with \$M\_\{$\backslash$rm halo\}$\backslash$geq 10\^\{10.5\}h\^\{-1\}\{$\backslash$rm M\}\_\{$\backslash$odot\}\$, with \$$\backslash$sim 90\$\% of them being central star-forming galaxies. The predicted mean halo occupation distributions of [OII] emitters has a shape typical of that inferred for star-forming galaxies, with the contribution from central galaxies, \$\_\{[OII],cen\}\$, being far from the canonical step function. The \$\_\{[OII],cen\}\$ can be described as the sum of an asymmetric Gaussian for disks and a step function for spheroids, which plateaus below unity. The model [OII] emitters have a clustering bias close to unity, which is below the expectations for eBOSS and DESI ELGs. At \$z$\backslash$sim 1\$, a comparison with observed g-band selected galaxy, which are expected to be dominated by [OII] emitters, indicates that our model produces too few [OII] emitters that are satellite galaxies. This suggests the need to revise our modelling of hot gas stripping in satellite galaxies.},

The continuity equation requires two specific inputs gauged on observations: (i) the star formation rate functions determined on the basis of the latest UV+far-IR/sub-mm/radio measurements; (ii) average star-formation histories for individual galaxies, with different prescriptions for discs and spheroids. The continuity equation also includes a source term taking into account (dry) mergers, based on recent numerical simulations and consistent with observations. The stellar mass function derived from the continuity equation is coupled with the halo mass function and with the SFR functions to derive the star formation efficiency and the main sequence of star-forming galaxies via the abundance matching technique. A remarkable agreement of the resulting stellar mass function for active and quiescent galaxies, of the galaxy main sequence and of the star-formation efficiency with current observations is found; the comparison with data also allows to robustly constrain the characteristic timescales for star formation and quiescence of massive galaxies, the star formation history of their progenitors, and the amount of stellar mass added by in-situ star formation vs. that contributed by external merger events. The continuity equation is shown to yield quantitative outcomes that must be complied by detailed physical models, that can provide a basis to improve the (sub-grid) physical recipes implemented in theoretical approaches and numerical simulations, and that can offer a benchmark for forecasts on future observations with multi-band coverage, as it will become routinely achievable in the era of JWST.},

  title = {The Impact of Galaxy Formation on Satellite Kinematics and Redshift-Space Distortions},
  abstract = {Galaxy surveys aim to map the large-scale structure of the Universe and use redshift space distortions to constrain deviations from general relativity and to probe the existence of mas- sive neutrinos. However, the amount of information that can be extracted will be limited by the accuracy of theoretical models used to analyze the data. Here, by using the L-Galaxies semi-analytical model run over the MXXL N-body simulation, we assess the impact of galaxy formation on satellite kinematics and the theoretical modelling of redshift-space distortions. We show that different galaxy selection criteria lead to noticeable differences in the radial distributions and velocity structure of satellite galaxies. Specifically, whereas samples of stel- lar mass selected galaxies feature satellites that roughly follow the dark matter, emission line satellite galaxies are located preferentially in the outskirts of halos and display net infall veloc- ities. We demonstrate that capturing these differences is crucial for modelling the multipoles of the correlation function in redshift space, even on large scales. In particular, we show how modelling small scale velocities with a single Gaussian distribution leads to a poor description of the measure clustering. In contrast, we propose a parametrization that is flexible enough to model the satellite kinematics, and that leads to and accurate description of the correlation function down to sub-Mpc scales. We anticipate that our model will be a necessary ingredient in improved theoretical descriptions of redshift space distortions, which together could result in a significantly tighter on cosmological constraints and more optimal exploitation of future large datasets.},

Using the Large Suite of Dark Matter Simulations (LasDamas) we consider nine commonly used halo properties and find that a clustering bias exists if halos are binned by mass or by any other halo property. This secondary bias implies that no single halo property encompasses all the spatial clustering information of the halo population. The mean values of some halo properties depend on their halo's distance to a more massive neighbor. Halo samples selected by having high values of one of these properties therefore inherit a neighbor bias such that they are much more likely to be close to a much more massive neighbor. This neighbor bias largely accounts for the secondary bias seen in halos binned by mass and split by concentration or age. However, halos binned by other mass-like properties still show a secondary bias even when the neighbor bias is removed. The secondary bias of halos selected by their spin behaves differently than that for other halo properties, suggesting that the origin of the spin bias is different than of other secondary biases.},

recently been quenched of their star formation. Our analysis also
affords a breakdown of all COSMOS galaxies into the relative numbers of
central and satellite galaxies for both populations. At z = 1, satellite
galaxies dominate the red sequence below the knee in the stellar mass
function. But the number of quiescent satellites exhibits minimal
redshift evolution; all evolution in the red sequence is due to low-mass
central galaxies being quenched of their star formation. At M

central galaxies on the red sequence increases by a factor of 10 over
our redshift baseline, while the fraction of quenched satellite galaxies

the red sequence as the time derivative of the passive galaxy

red sequence increases by nearly an order of magnitude from z = 1 to z =

for centrals is increasing with cosmic time, while the mechanisms that

Predictions for haloes are based on the non-local bias model, employing linear (\$b\_1\$) and non-linear (\$c\_2\$, \$g\_2\$) bias parameters, which have been constrained previously from the bispectrum in Fourier space. We also study predictions from two other bias models, one local (\$g\_2=0\$) and one in which \$c\_2\$ and \$g\_2\$ are determined by \$b\_1\$ via an approximately universal relation. Overall, measurements and predictions agree when \$Q\$ is derived for triangles with \$(r\_1r\_2r\_3)\^\{1/3\} $\backslash$gtrsim 60 h\^\{-1\}$\backslash$text\{Mpc\}\$, where \$r\_\{1-3\}\$ are the sizes of the triangle legs. Predictions for \$Q\_\{matter\}\$, based on the linear power spectrum, show significant deviations from the measurements at the BAO scale (given our small measurement errors), which strongly decrease when adding a damping term or using the non-linear power spectrum, as expected. Predictions for \$Q\_\{halo\}\$ agree best with measurements at large scales when considering non-local contributions. The universal bias model works well for haloes and might therefore be also useful for tightening constraints on \$b\_1\$ from \$Q\$ in galaxy surveys. Such constraints are independent of the amplitude of matter density fluctuation (\$$\backslash$sigma\_8\$) and hence break the degeneracy between \$b\_1\$ and \$$\backslash$sigma\_8\$, present in galaxy two-point correlations.},

  abstract = {We present here a simple model for the star formation history (SFH) of 
galaxies that is successful in describing both the star formation rate
density (SFRD) over cosmic time, as well as the distribution of specific
star formation rates (sSFRs) of galaxies at the current epoch, and the
evolution of this quantity in galaxy populations to a redshift of z = 1.
We show first that the cosmic SFRD is remarkably well described by a
simple log-normal in time. We next postulate that this functional form
for the ensemble is also a reasonable description for the SFHs of
individual galaxies. Using the measured sSFRs for galaxies at z \textasciitilde{} 0 from
Paper III in this series, we then construct a realization of a universe
populated by such galaxies in which the parameters of the log-normal SFH
of each galaxy are adjusted to match the sSFRs at z \textasciitilde{} 0 as well as
fitting, in ensemble, the cosmic SFRD from z = 0 to z = 8. This model
predicts, with striking fidelity, the distribution of sSFRs in
mass-limited galaxy samples to z = 1; this match is not achieved by
other models with a different functional form for the SFHs of individual
galaxies, but with the same number of degrees of freedom, suggesting
that the log-normal form is well matched to the likely actual histories
of individual galaxies. We also impose the sSFR versus mass
distributions at higher redshifts from Paper III as constraints on the
model, and show that, as previously suggested, some galaxies in the
field, particularly low mass galaxies, are quite young at intermediate
redshifts. As emphasized in Paper III, starbursts are insufficient to
explain the enhanced sSFRs in intermediate redshift galaxies; we show
here that a model using only smoothly varying log-normal SFHs for
galaxies, which allows for some fraction of the population to have peak
star formation at late times, does however fully explain the
observations. Finally, we show that this model, constrained in detail
only at redshifts z $<$ 1, also produces the main sequence of
star-formation observed at 1.5 $<$ z $<$ 2.5, again suggesting that
the log-normal SFHs are a close approximation to the actual histories of
typical galaxies.},

We demonstrate that this goal can be achieve with our new Parallel Particle-Mesh (PM) Nbody code (PPM-GLAM) at a very low computational cost. We run about 15,000 simulations with \textasciitilde{}2 billion particles that provide \textasciitilde{}1\% accuracy of the dark matter power spectra P(k) for wave-numbers up to k\textasciitilde{} 1h/Mpc. Using this large data-set we study the power spectrum covariance matrix, the stepping stone for producing mock catalogs. In contrast to many previous analytical and numerical results, we find that the covariance matrix normalised to the power spectrum C(k,k')/P(k)P(k') has a complex structure of non-diagonal components. It has an upturn at small k, followed by a minimum at k=0.1-0.2h/Mpc. It also has a maximum at k=0.5-0.6h/Mpc. The normalised covariance matrix strongly evolves with redshift: C(k,k')\textasciitilde{}delta(t)\^alpha P(k)P(k'), where delta is the linear growth factor and alpha \textasciitilde{} 1-1.25, which indicates that the covariance matrix depends on cosmological parameters. We also show that waves longer than 1Gpc have very little impact on the power spectrum and covariance matrix. This significantly reduces the computational costs and complexity of theoretical predictions: relatively small volume \textasciitilde{} (1Gpc)\^3 simulations capture the necessary properties of dark matter clustering statistics. All the power spectra obtained from many thousands of our simulations are publicly available.},

This leads to a likelihood function that is no longer Gaussian, but rather an adapted version of a multivariate t-distribution, which has the same numerical complexity as the multivariate Gaussian.

  abstract = {A key unresolved question is the role that galaxy mergers play in driving stellar mass growth over cosmic time. Recent observational work hints at the possibility that the overall contribution of ‘major' mergers (mass ratios \$$\backslash$gtrsim\$1:4) to cosmic stellar mass growth may be small, because they enhance star formation rates by relatively small amounts at high redshift, when much of today's stellar mass was assembled. However, the heterogeneity and relatively small size of today's datasets, coupled with the difficulty in identifying genuine mergers, makes it challenging to \$$\backslash$textit\{empirically\}\$ quantify the merger contribution to stellar mass growth. Here, we use Horizon-AGN, a cosmological hydrodynamical simulation, to comprehensively quantify the contribution of mergers to the star formation budget over the lifetime of the Universe. We show that: (1) both major and minor mergers enhance star formation to similar amounts, (2) the fraction of star formation directly attributable to merging is small at all redshifts (e.g. \$$\backslash$sim\$35 and \$$\backslash$sim\$20 per cent at z\$$\backslash$sim\$3 and z\$$\backslash$sim\$1 respectively) and (3) only \$$\backslash$sim\$25 per cent of today's stellar mass is directly attributable to galaxy mergers over cosmic time.

  doi = {10.1111/j.1365-2966.2004.07530.x},
  abstract = {It is widely believed that maximum-likelihood estimators must be used to 
provide optimal estimates of power spectra. Since such estimators
require the inversion and multiplication of
Nd\texttimes{}Nd matrices, where Nd is the
size of the data vector, maximum-likelihood estimators require at least
of order N3d operations and become computationally
prohibitive for Nd greater than a few tens of thousands.
Because of this, a large and inhomogeneous literature exists on
approximate methods of power-spectrum estimation. These range from
manifestly suboptimal but computationally fast methods, to near-optimal
but computationally expensive methods. Furthermore, much of this
literature concentrates on the power-spectrum estimates rather than the
equally important problem of deriving an accurate covariance matrix. In
this paper, I consider the problem of estimating the power spectrum of
cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies from large data sets.
Various analytic results on power-spectrum estimators are derived, or
collated from the literature, and tested against numerical simulations.
An unbiased hybrid estimator is proposed that combines a
maximum-likelihood estimator at low multipoles and pseudo-Cl
estimates at high multipoles. The hybrid estimator is computationally
fast (i.e. it can be run on a laptop computer for Planck-sized data
sets), nearly optimal over the full range of multipoles, and returns an
accurate and nearly diagonal covariance matrix for realistic
experimental configurations (provided certain conditions on the noise
properties of the experiment are satisfied). It is argued that, in
practice, computationally expensive methods that approximate the
maximum-likelihood solution are unlikely to improve on the hybrid
estimator, and may actually perform worse. The results presented here
can be generalized to CMB polarization and to power-spectrum estimation
using other types of data, such as galaxy clustering and weak
gravitational lensing.},

  abstract = {Microwave background temperature and polarization observations are a powerful way to constrain cosmological parameters if the likelihood function can be calculated accurately. The temperature and polarization fields are correlated, partial sky coverage correlates power spectrum estimators at different ell, and the likelihood function for a theory spectrum given a set of observed estimators is non-Gaussian. An accurate analysis must model all these properties. Most existing likelihood approximations are good enough for a temperature-only analysis, however they cannot reliably handle a temperature-polarization correlations. We give a new general approximation applicable for correlated Gaussian fields observed on part of the sky. The approximation models the non-Gaussian form exactly in the ideal full-sky limit and is fast to evaluate using a pre-computed covariance matrix and set of power spectrum estimators. We show with simulations that it is good enough to obtain correct results at ell $>$\textasciitilde{} 30 where an exact calculation becomes impossible. We also show that some Gaussian approximations give reliable parameter constraints even though they do not capture the shape of the likelihood function at each ell accurately. Finally we test the approximations on simulations with realistically anisotropic noise and asymmetric foreground mask.},

When used in Bayesian parameter estimation, their likelihood function is usually replaced by a Gaussian approximation. However, this has been shown to be insufficient. Aims: For the case of Gaussian random fields, we search for an exact probability distribution of correlation functions, which could improve the accuracy of future data analyses. Methods: We use a fully analytic approach, first expanding the random field in its Fourier modes, and then calculating the characteristic function. Finally, we derive the probability distribution function using integration by residues. We use a numerical implementation of the full analytic formula to discuss the behaviour of this function. Results: We derive the univariate and bivariate probability distribution function of the correlation functions of a Gaussian random field, and outline how higher joint distributions could be calculated. We give the results in the form of mode expansions, but in one special case we also find a closed-form expression. We calculate the moments of the distribution and, in the univariate case, we discuss the Edgeworth expansion approximation. We also comment on the difficulties in a fast and exact numerical implementation of our results, and on possible future applications.},

  abstract = {Measurements of correlation functions and their comparison with theoretical models are often employed in natural sciences, including astrophysics and cosmology, to determine best-fitting model parameters and their confidence regions. Due to a lack of better descriptions, the likelihood function of the correlation function is often assumed to be a multi-variate Gaussian. Using different methods, we show that
correlation functions have to satisfy constraint relations, owing to the non-negativity of the power spectrum of the underlying random process. Specifically, for any statistically homogeneous and (for more than one spatial dimension) isotropic random field with correlation function $\xi$(x), we derive inequalities for the correlation coefficients
r\_n$\equiv$ $\xi$(n x)/$\xi$(0) (for integer n) of the form
rnl$\leq$ r\_n$\leq$ rnu, where the lower and upper
bounds on rn depend on the r\_j, with jn-\{ $\xi$(0),$\xi$(x),
$\xi$(2x),dots,$\xi$([n-1]x) \}$\leq$ $\xi$(n x) $\leq$ $\Xi$n+\{
$\xi$(0),$\xi$(x), $\xi$(2x),dots,$\xi$([n-1]x) \}. Explicit expressions for
the bounds are obtained for arbitrary n. We show that these constraint equations very significantly limit the set of possible correlation functions. For one particular example of a fiducial cosmic shear survey, we show that the Gaussian likelihood ellipsoid has a significant spill-over into the region of correlation functions forbidden by the aforementioned constraints, rendering the resulting best-fitting model parameters and their error region questionable, and indicating the need for a better description of the likelihood function. We conduct some simple numerical experiments which explicitly demonstrate the failure of a Gaussian description for the likelihood of $\xi$. Instead, the shape of the likelihood function of the correlation coefficients appears to follow approximately the shape of the bounds on the r\_n, even if the Gaussian ellipsoid lies well within the allowed region. Therefore, we define a non-linear and coupled transformation of the r\_n, based on these bounds. Some numerical experiments then indicate that a Gaussian is a much better description of the likelihood in these transformed variables than of the original correlation coefficients - in particular, the full probability distribution then lies explicitly in the allowed region. For more than one spatial dimension of the random field, the explicit expressions of the bounds on the rn are not optimal. We outline a geometrical method how tighter bounds may be obtained in principle. We illustrate this method for a few simple cases; a more general treatment awaits future work.},

  abstract = {Aims: We study the validity of the approximation of a Gaussian cosmic 
shear likelihood. We estimate the true likelihood for a fiducial
cosmological model from a large set of ray-tracing simulations and
investigate the impact of non-Gaussianity on cosmological parameter
estimation. We investigate how odd the recently reported very low value
of $\sigma$8 really is as derived from the Chandra Deep Field
South (CDFS) using cosmic shear by taking the non-Gaussianity of the
likelihood into account, as well as the possibility of biases coming
from the way the CDFS was selected. Methods: A brute force
approach to estimating the likelihood from simulations must fail because
of the high dimensionality of the problem. We therefore use independent
component analysis to transform the cosmic shear correlation functions
to a new basis, in which the likelihood approximately factorises into a
product of one-dimensional distributions. Results: We find that
the cosmic shear likelihood is significantly non-Gaussian. This leads to
both a shift of the maximum of the posterior distribution and a
significantly smaller credible region compared to the Gaussian case. We
re-analyse the CDFS cosmic shear data using the non-Gaussian likelihood
in combination with conservative galaxy selection criteria that minimise
calibration uncertainties. Assuming that the CDFS is a random pointing,
we find $\sigma$\_8=0.68-0.16+0.09 for fixed
$\Omega$\_m=0.25. In a WMAP5-like cosmology, a value equal to or lower
than this would be expected in $\approx$ 5\% of the times. Taking biases into
account arising from the way the CDFS was selected, which we model as
being dependent on the number of haloes in the CDFS, we obtain
$\sigma$8 = 0.71+0.10-0.15. Combining
the CDFS data with the parameter constraints from WMAP5 yields
$\Omega$m = 0.26+0.03-0.02 and
$\sigma$8 = 0.79+0.04-0.03 for a flat

  abstract = {Context: In cosmic shear likelihood analyses, the covariance is most 
commonly assumed to be constant in parameter space. Therefore, when
calculating the covariance matrix (analytically or from simulations),
its underlying cosmology should not influence the likelihood contours.
Aims: We examine whether the aforementioned assumptions hold and
quantify how strong cosmic shear covariances vary within a reasonable
parameter range. Furthermore, we examine the impact on likelihood
contours when assuming different cosmologies in the covariance. The
final goal is to develop an improved likelihood analysis for parameter
estimation with cosmic shear. Methods: We calculate Gaussian
covariances analytically for 2500 different cosmologies. To quantify the
impact on the parameter constraints, we perform a likelihood analysis
for each covariance matrix and compare the likelihood contours. To
improve on the assumption of a constant covariance, we use an adaptive
covariance matrix, which is continuously updated according to the point
in parameter space where the likelihood is evaluated. As a side-effect,
this cosmology-dependent covariance improves the parameter constraints.
We examine this more closely using the Fisher-matrix formalism. In
addition, we quantify the impact of non-Gaussian covariances on the
likelihood contours using a ray-tracing covariance derived from the
Millennium simulation. In this ansatz, we return to the approximation of
a cosmology-independent covariance matrix, and to minimize the error due
to this approximation, we develop the concept of an iterative likelihood
analysis. Results: Covariances vary significantly within the
considered parameter range. The cosmology assumed in the covariance has
a non-negligible impact on the size of the likelihood contours. This
impact increases with increasing survey size, increasing number density
of source galaxies, decreasing ellipticity noise, and when taking
non-Gaussianity into account. A proper treatment of this effect is
therefore even more important for future surveys. In this paper, we
present methods for taking cosmology-dependent covariances into account.},

  abstract = {We constrain the spatial gradient of star formation history within galaxies using the colour gradients in NUV-u and u-i for a local spatially-resolved galaxy sample. By splitting each galaxy into an inner and an outer part, we find that most galaxies show negative gradients in these two colours. We first rule out dust extinction gradient and metallicity gradient as the dominant source for the colour gradient. Then using stellar population models, we explore variations in star formation history to explain the colour gradients. As shown by our earlier work, a two-phase SFH consisting of an early secular evolution (growth) phase and a subsequent rapid evolution (quenching) phase is necessary to explain the observed colour distributions among galaxies. We explore two different inside-out growth models and two different inside-out quenching models by varying parameters of the SFH between inner and outer regions of galaxies. Two of the models can explain the observed range of colour gradients in NUV-u and u-i colours. We further distinguish them using an additional constraint provided by the u-i colour gradient distribution, under the assumption of constant galaxy formation rate and a common SFH followed by most galaxies. We find the best model is an inside-out growth model in which the inner region has a shorter e-folding time scale in the growth phase than the outer region. More spatially resolved ultraviolet (UV) observations are needed to improve the significance of the result.},

We apply spectral synthesis techniques to the datacubes and process the results to produce the mass growth time scales and mass weighted ages, from which we obtain temporal and spatially resolved information in seven bins of galaxy morphology and six bins of stellar mass (M\$\_\{$\backslash$star\}\$) and stellar mass surface density (\$$\backslash$Sigma\_\{$\backslash$star\}\$). We use three different tracers of the spatially resolved star formation history (mass assembly curves, ratio of half mass to half light radii, and mass-weighted age gradients) to test if galaxies grow inside-out, and its dependence with galaxy stellar mass, \$$\backslash$Sigma\_\{$\backslash$star\}\$, and morphology. Our main results are as follows: (a) The innermost regions of galaxies assemble their mass at an earlier time than regions located in the outer parts; this happens at any given M\$\_\{$\backslash$star\}\$, \$$\backslash$Sigma\_\{$\backslash$star\}\$, or Hubble type, including the lowest mass systems. (b) Galaxies present a significant diversity in their characteristic formation epochs for lower-mass systems. This diversity shows a strong dependence of the mass assembly time scales on \$$\backslash$Sigma\_\{$\backslash$star\}\$ and Hubble type in the lower-mass range (10\$\^\{8.4\}\$ to 10\$\^\{10.4\}\$), but a very mild dependence in higher-mass bins. (c) All galaxies show negative \$$\backslash$langle\$log age\$$\backslash$rangle\_\{M\}\$ gradients in the inner 1 HLR. The profile flattens with increasing values of \$$\backslash$Sigma\_\{$\backslash$star\}\$.

The stacked color-magnitude diagrams are used to define red and blue galaxies in clusters for studying their radial number density profiles without resorting to photometric redshifts of individual galaxies. We find that red galaxies are significantly more concentrated toward cluster centers and blue galaxies dominate the outskirt of clusters. We explore the fraction of red galaxies in clusters as a function of redshift, and find that the red fraction decreases with increasing distances from cluster centers. The red fraction exhibits a moderate decrease with increasing redshift. The radial number density profiles of cluster member galaxies are also used to infer the location of the steepest slope in the three dimensional galaxy density profiles.

piece together the nature of its velocity and spatial structure. Core
helium burning red clump (RC) stars have similar luminosities, are
abundant throughout the Galaxy, and thus constitute good standard
candles. We build a hierarchical probabilistic model to quantify the
quality of RC stars as standard candles using parallax measurements from
the first Gaia data release. A unique aspect of our methodology is to
fully account for (and marginalize over) parallax, photometry, and dust
corrections uncertainties, which leads to more robust results than
standard approaches. We determine the absolute magnitude and intrinsic
dispersion of the RC in 2MASS bands J, H, Ks, Gaia G band, and WISE
bands W1, W2, W3, and W4. We find that the absolute magnitude of the RC
is \$-1.61 $\backslash$pm\$ 0.01 (in Ks), \$+0.44 $\backslash$pm\$ 0.01 (in G) , \$-0.93 $\backslash$pm\$ 0.01

mean intrinsic dispersion is \$$\backslash$sim 0.17 $\backslash$pm\$ 0.03 mag across all bands
(yielding a typical distance precision of \$$\backslash$sim\$ 8\%). Thus RC stars are
reliable and precise standard candles. In addition, we have also
re-calibrated the zero point of the absolute magnitude of the RC in each
band, which provide a benchmark for future studies to estimate distances
to RC stars. Finally, the parallax error shrinkage in the hierarchical
model outlined in this work can be used to obtain more precise
parallaxes than Gaia for the most distant RC stars across the Galaxy.},

  abstract = {Context. Whenever correlation functions are used for inference about 
cosmological parameters in the context of a Bayesian analysis, the
likelihood function of correlation functions needs to be known. Usually,
it is approximated as a multivariate Gaussian, though this is not
necessarily a good approximation. Aims: We show how to calculate
a better approximation for the probability distribution of correlation
functions of one-dimensional random fields, which we call
"quasi-Gaussian". Methods: Using the exact univariate probability
distribution function (PDF) as well as constraints on correlation
functions previously derived, we transform the correlation functions to
an unconstrained variable for which the Gaussian approximation is well
justified. From this Gaussian in the transformed space, we obtain the
quasi-Gaussian PDF. The two approximations for the probability
distributions are compared to the "true" distribution as obtained from
simulations. Additionally, we test how the new approximation performs
when used as likelihood in a toy-model Bayesian analysis. 
Results: The quasi-Gaussian PDF agrees very well with the PDF obtained
from simulations; in particular, it provides a significantly better
description than a straightforward copula approach. In a simple
toy-model likelihood analysis, it yields noticeably different results
than the Gaussian likelihood, indicating its possible impact on
cosmological parameter estimation.

Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey Final Data Release (BOSS DR11\&DR12)
with high fidelity on all relevant scales in order to allow a robust
analysis of baryon acoustic oscillations and redshift space distortions.
We have generated (6000) 12 288 MultiDark PATCHY BOSS (DR11) DR12 light
cones corresponding to an effective volume of \texttildelow{}192 000
[h-1 Gpc]3 (the largest ever simulated volume),
including cosmic evolution in the redshift range from 0.15 to 0.75. The
mocks have been calibrated using a reference galaxy catalogue based on
the halo abundance matching modelling of the BOSS DR11\&DR12 galaxy
clustering data and on the data themselves. The production follows three
steps. First, we apply the PATCHY code to generate a dark matter field
and an object distribution including non-linear stochastic galaxy bias.
Secondly, we run the halo/stellar distribution reconstruction HADRON
code to assign masses to the various objects. This step uses the mass
distribution as a function of local density and non-local indicators
(i.e. tidal field tensor eigenvalues and relative halo exclusion
separation for massive objects) from the reference simulation applied to
the corresponding patchy dark matter and galaxy distribution. Finally,
we apply the SUGAR code to build the light cones. The resulting
MultiDarkPATCHY mock light cones reproduce the number density, selection
function, survey geometry, and in general within 1$\sigma$, for arbitrary
stellar mass bins, the power spectrum up to k = 0.3 h Mpc-1,
the two-point correlation functions down to a few Mpc scales, and the
three-point statistics of the BOSS DR11\&DR12 galaxy samples.},

  shorttitle = {On the Use of the {{Edgeworth}} Expansion in Cosmology {{I}}},
  abstract = {Non-linear gravitational collapse introduces non-Gaussian statistics into the matter fields of the late Universe. As the large-scale structure is the target of current and future observational campaigns, one would ideally like to have the full probability density function of these non-Gaussian fields. The only viable way we see to achieve this analytically, at least approximately and in the near future, is via the Edgeworth expansion. We hence rederive this expansion for Fourier modes of non-Gaussian fields and then continue by putting it into a wider statistical context than previously done. We show that in its original form, the Edgeworth expansion only works if the non-Gaussian signal is averaged away. This is counterproductive, since we target the parameter-dependent non-Gaussianities as a signal of interest. We hence alter the analysis at the decisive step and now provide a roadmap towards a controlled and unadulterated analysis of non-Gaussianities in structure formation (with the Edgeworth expansion). Our central result is that, although the Edgeworth expansion has pathological properties, these can be predicted and avoided in a careful manner. We also show that, despite the non-Gaussianity coupling all modes, the Edgeworth series may be applied to any desired subset of modes, since this is equivalent (to the level of the approximation) to marginalising over the exlcuded modes. In this first paper of a series, we restrict ourselves to the sampling properties of the Edgeworth expansion, i.e.\textasciitilde{}how faithfully it reproduces the distribution of non-Gaussian data. A follow-up paper will detail its Bayesian use, when parameters are to be inferred.},

  abstract = {We perform a detailed analysis of the covariance matrix of the spherically averaged galaxy power spectrum and present a new, practical method for estimating this within an arbitrary survey without the need for running mock galaxy simulations that cover the full survey volume. The method uses theoretical arguments to modify the covariance matrix measured from a set of small-volume cubic galaxy simulations, which are computationally cheap to produce compared to larger simulations and match the measured small-scale galaxy clustering more accurately than is possible using theoretical modelling. We include prescriptions to analytically account for the window function of the survey, which convolves the measured covariance matrix in a non-trivial way. We also present a new method to include the effects of supersample covariance and modes outside the small simulation volume which requires no additional simulations and still allows us to scale the covariance matrix. As validation, we compare the covariance matrix estimated using our new method to that from a brute force calculation using 500 simulations originally created for analysis of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Main Galaxy Sample (SDSS-MGS). We find excellent agreement on all scales of interest for large scale structure analysis, including those dominated by the effects of the survey window, and on scales where theoretical models of the clustering normally break-down, but the new method produces a covariance matrix with significantly better signal-to-noise. Although only formally correct in real-space, we also discuss how our method can be extended to incorporate the effects of Redshift Space Distortions.},

  abstract = {We explore two methods of compressing the redshift space galaxy power spectrum and bispectrum with respect to a chosen set of cosmological parameters. Both methods involve reducing the dimension of the original data-vector ( e.g. 1000 elements ) to the number of cosmological parameters considered ( e.g. seven ) using the Karhunen-Lo$\backslash$‘eve algorithm. In the first case, we run MCMC sampling on the compressed data-vector in order to recover the one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) posterior distributions. The second option, approximately 2000 times faster, works by orthogonalising the parameter space through diagonalisation of the Fisher information matrix before the compression, obtaining the posterior distributions without the need of MCMC sampling. Using these methods for future spectroscopic redshift surveys like DESI, EUCLID and PFS would drastically reduce the number of simulations needed to compute accurate covariance matrices with minimal loss of constraining power. We consider a redshift bin of a DESI-like experiment. Using the power spectrum combined with the bispectrum as a data-vector, both compression methods on average recover the 68\% credible regions to within 0.5\% and 3.2\% of those resulting from standard MCMC sampling respectively. These confidence intervals are also smaller than the ones obtained using only the power spectrum by (81\%, 80\%, 82\%) respectively for the bias parameter b\_1, the growth rate f and the scalar amplitude parameter A\_s.},

  abstract = {Using the stellar kinematic maps and ancillary imaging data from the Sydney AAO Multi Integral field (SAMI) Galaxy Survey, the intrinsic shape of kinematically-selected samples of galaxies is inferred. We implement an efficient and optimised algorithm to fit the intrinsic shape of galaxies using an established method to simultaneously invert the distributions of apparent ellipticities and kinematic misalignments. The algorithm output compares favourably with previous studies of the intrinsic shape of galaxies based on imaging alone and our re-analysis of the ATLAS3D data. Our results indicate that most galaxies are oblate axisymmetric. We show empirically that the intrinsic shape of galaxies varies as a function of their rotational support as measured by the "spin" parameter proxy Lambda\_Re. In particular, low spin systems have a higher occurrence of triaxiality, while high spin systems are more intrinsically flattened and axisymmetric. The intrinsic shape of galaxies is linked to their formation and merger histories. Galaxies with high spin values have intrinsic shapes consistent with dissipational minor mergers, while the intrinsic shape of low-spin systems is consistent with dissipationless multi-merger assembly histories. This range in assembly histories inferred from intrinsic shapes is broadly consistent with expectations from cosmological simulations.},

The survey design includes a pattern of tiling on the sky and the locations of the fiber positioners in the focal plane of the telescope, with the observation strategy determined by a fiber assignment algorithm that optimizes the allocation of fibers to targets. This strategy allows a given region to be covered on average five times for a five-year survey, but with coverage varying between zero and twelve, which imprints a spatially-dependent pattern on the galaxy clustering. We investigate the systematic effects of the fiber assignment coverage on the anisotropic galaxy clustering of ELGs and show that, in the absence of any corrections, it leads to discrepancies of order ten percent on large scales for the power spectrum multipoles. We introduce a method where objects in a random catalog are assigned a coverage, and the mean density is separately computed for each coverage factor. We show that this method reduces, but does not eliminate the effect. We next investigate the angular dependence of the contaminated signal, arguing that it is mostly localized to purely transverse modes. We demonstrate that the cleanest way to remove the contaminating signal is to perform an analysis of the anisotropic power spectrum \$P(k,$\backslash$mu)\$ and remove the lowest \$$\backslash$mu\$ bin, leaving \$$\backslash$mu$>$0\$ modes accurate at the few-percent level. Here, \$$\backslash$mu\$ is the cosine of the angle between the line-of-sight and the direction of \$$\backslash$vec\{k\}\$.

  abstract = {Since cosmology is no longer ‘‘the data-starved science,'' the problem 
of how to analyze large data sets best has recently received
considerable attention, and Karhunen-Lo\`eve eigenvalue methods
have been applied to both galaxy redshift surveys and cosmic microwave
background (CMB) maps. We present a comprehensive discussion of methods
for estimating cosmological parameters from large data sets, which
includes the previously published techniques as special cases. We show
that both the problem of estimating several parameters jointly and the
problem of not knowing the parameters a priori can be readily solved by
adding an extra singular value decomposition step.

It has recently been argued that the information content in a sky map
from a next-generation CMB satellite is sufficient to measure key
cosmological parameters (h, $\Omega$, $\Lambda$, etc.) to an accuracy of a
few percent or better--in principle. In practice, the data set is so
large that both a brute force likelihood analysis and a direct expansion
in signal-to-noise eigenmodes will be computationally unfeasible. We
argue that it is likely that a Karhunen-Lo\`eve approach can
nonetheless measure the parameters with close to maximal accuracy, if
preceded by an appropriate form of quadratic ‘‘precompression.''

We also discuss practical issues regarding parameter estimation from
present and future galaxy redshift surveys and illustrate this with a
generalized eigenmode analysis of the IRAS 1.2 Jy survey optimized for
measuring $\beta$ $\equiv$ $\Omega$0.6/b using redshift space
distortions.},

  shorttitle = {Emulating Galaxy Clustering and Galaxy-Galaxy Lensing into the Deeply Nonlinear Regime},
  abstract = {The combination of galaxy-galaxy lensing (GGL) with galaxy clustering is one of the most promising routes to determining the amplitude of matter clustering at low redshifts. We show that extending clustering+GGL analyses from the linear regime down to \$$\backslash$sim 0.5 $\backslash$, h\^\{-1\}\$ Mpc scales increases their constraining power considerably, even after marginalizing over a flexible model of non-linear galaxy bias. Using a grid of cosmological N-body simulations, we construct a Taylor-expansion emulator that predicts the galaxy autocorrelation \$$\backslash$xi\_\{$\backslash$text\{gg\}\}(r)\$ and galaxy-matter cross-correlation \$$\backslash$xi\_\{$\backslash$text\{gm\}\}(r)\$ as a function of \$$\backslash$sigma\_8\$, \$$\backslash$Omega\_m\$, and halo occupation distribution (HOD) parameters, which are allowed to vary with large scale environment to represent possible effects of galaxy assembly bias. We present forecasts for a fiducial case that corresponds to BOSS LOWZ galaxy clustering and SDSS-depth weak lensing (effective source density \$$\backslash$sim 0.3\$ arcmin\$\^\{-2\}\$). Using tangential shear and projected correlation function measurements over \$0.5 $\backslash$leq r\_p $\backslash$leq 30 $\backslash$, h\^\{-1\}\$ Mpc yields a 1.8\% constraint on the parameter combination \$$\backslash$sigma\_8$\backslash$Omega\_m\^\{0.58\}\$, a factor of two better than a constraint that excludes non-linear scales (\$r\_p $>$ 2 $\backslash$, h\^\{-1\}\$ Mpc, \$4 $\backslash$, h\^\{-1\}\$ Mpc for \$$\backslash$gamma\_t,w\_p\$). Much of this improvement comes from the non-linear clustering information, which breaks degeneracies among HOD parameters that would otherwise degrade the inference of matter clustering from GGL. Increasing the effective source density to \$3\$ arcmin\$\^\{-2\}\$ sharpens the constraint on \$$\backslash$sigma\_8$\backslash$Omega\_m\^\{0.58\}\$ by a further factor of two. With robust modeling into the non-linear regime, low-redshift measurements of matter clustering at the 1-percent level with clustering+GGL alone are well within reach of current data sets such as those provided by the Dark Energy Survey.},

  abstract = {Efficient estimators of Fourier-space statistics for large number of objects rely on fast Fourier transforms (FFTs), which are affected by aliasing from unresolved small-scale modes due to the finite FFT grid. Aliasing takes the form of a sum over images, each of them corresponding to the Fourier content displaced by increasing multiples of the sampling frequency of the grid. These spurious contributions limit the accuracy in the estimation of Fourier-space statistics, and are typically ameliorated by simultaneously increasing grid size and discarding high-frequency modes. This results in inefficient estimates for e.g. the power spectrum when desired systematic biases are well under per cent level. We show that using interlaced grids removes odd images, which include the dominant contribution to aliasing. In addition, we discuss the choice of interpolation kernel used to define density perturbations on the FFT grid and demonstrate that using higher order interpolation kernels than the standard Cloud-In-Cell algorithm results in significant reduction of the remaining images. We show that combining fourth-order interpolation with interlacing gives very accurate Fourier amplitudes and phases of density perturbations. This results in power spectrum and bispectrum estimates that have systematic biases below 0.01 per cent all the way to the Nyquist frequency of the grid, thus maximizing the use of unbiased Fourier coefficients for a given grid size and greatly reducing systematics for applications to large cosmological data sets.},

  abstract = {We explore observational and theoretical constraints on how galaxies might transition between the "star-forming main sequence" (SFMS) and varying "degrees of quiescence" out to \$z=3\$. Our analysis is focused on galaxies with stellar mass \$M\_*$>$10\^\{10\}M\_\{$\backslash$odot\}\$, and is enabled by GAMA and CANDELS observations, a semi-analytic model (SAM) of galaxy formation, and a cosmological hydrodynamical "zoom in" simulation with momentum-driven AGN feedback. In both the observations and the SAM, transition galaxies tend to have intermediate S$\backslash$'ersic indices, half-light radii, and surface stellar mass densities compared to star-forming and quiescent galaxies out to \$z=3\$. We place an observational upper limit on the average population transition timescale as a function of redshift, finding that the average high-redshift galaxy is on a "fast track" for quenching whereas the average low-redshift galaxy is on a "slow track" for quenching. We qualitatively identify four physical origin scenarios for transition galaxies in the SAM: oscillations on the SFMS, slow quenching, fast quenching, and rejuvenation. Quenching timescales in both the SAM and the hydrodynamical simulation are not fast enough to reproduce the quiescent population that we observe at \$z$\backslash$sim3\$. In the SAM, we do not find a clear-cut morphological dependence of quenching timescales, but we do predict that the mean stellar ages, cold gas fractions, SMBH masses, and halo masses of transition galaxies tend to be intermediate relative to those of star-forming and quiescent galaxies at \$z$<$3\$.},

  abstract = {It is now possible for hydrodynamical simulations to reproduce a representative galaxy population. Accordingly, it is timely to assess critically some of the assumptions of traditional semi-analytic galaxy formation models. We use the Eagle simulations to assess assumptions built into the Galform semi-analytic model, focussing on those relating to baryon cycling, angular momentum and feedback. We show that the assumption in Galform that newly formed stars have the same specific angular momentum as the total disc leads to a significant overestimate of the total stellar specific angular momentum of disc galaxies. In Eagle, stars form preferentially out of low specific angular momentum gas in the interstellar medium (ISM) due to the assumed gas density threshold for stars to form, leading to more realistic galaxy sizes. We find that stellar mass assembly is similar between Galform and Eagle but that the evolution of gas properties is different, with various indications that the rate of baryon cycling in Eagle is slower than is assumed in Galform. Finally, by matching individual galaxies between Eagle and Galform, we find that an artificial dependence of AGN feedback and gas infall rates on halo mass doubling events in Galform drives most of the scatter in stellar mass between individual objects. Put together our results suggest that the Galform semi-analytic model can be significantly improved in light of recent advances.},

We construct estimators for radial distortions that, using only Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs) of the overdensity field multipoles for a given survey geometry, compute the power spectrum monopole, quadrupole and hexadecapole, and generalize such estimators to the bispectrum. Using realistic mock catalogs we compare the signal to noise of two estimators for the power spectrum hexadecapole that require different number of FFTs and measure the bispectrum monopole, quadrupole and hexadecapole. The resulting algorithm is very efficient, e.g. for the BOSS survey requires about three minutes for \$$\backslash$ell=0,2,4\$ power spectra for scales up to \$k=0.3\textasciitilde{}h/\$Mpc and about fifteen additional minutes for \$$\backslash$ell=0,2,4\$ bispectra for all scales and triangle shapes up to \$k=0.2\textasciitilde{}h/\$Mpc on a single core. The speed of these estimators is essential as it makes possible to compute covariance matrices from large number of realizations of mock catalogs with realistic survey characteristics, and paves the way for improved constrains of gravity on cosmological scales, inflation and galaxy bias.},

Although the evolution of the bispectrum is well understood theoretically from non-linear perturbation theory and numerical simulations, applications to galaxy surveys require a number of issues to be addressed. In this paper we consider the effect on the bispectrum of stochastic non-linear biasing, radial redshift distortions, non-Gaussian initial conditions, survey geometry and sampling. We find that: 1) bias stochasticity does not affect the use of the bispectrum to recover the mean biasing relation between galaxies and mass, at least for models in which the scatter is uncorrelated at large scales. 2) radial redshift distortions do not change significantly the monopole power spectrum and bispectrum compared to their plane-parallel values. 3) survey geometry leads to finite volume effects which must be taken into account in current surveys before comparison with theoretical predictions can be made. 4) sparse sampling and survey geometry correlate different triangles leading to a breakdown of the Gaussian likelihood approximation. We develop a likelihood analysis using bispectrum eigenmodes, calculated by Monte Carlo realizations of mock surveys generated with second-order Lagrangian perturbation theory and checked against N-body simulations. In a companion paper we apply these results to the analysis of the bispectrum of IRAS galaxies.},

Our model combines the evolution of the locus on the BPT diagram measured in spectroscopic data out to z \textasciitilde{} 2.5 with the strong dependence of [NII]/H\$$\backslash$alpha\$ on stellar mass and [OIII]/H\$$\backslash$beta\$ observed in local galaxy samples. We find large variations in the [NII]/H\$$\backslash$alpha\$ flux ratio at a fixed redshift due to its dependency on stellar mass, hence the assumption of a constant [NII] contamination fraction can lead to a significant under- or over-estimate of H\$$\backslash$alpha\$ luminosities. Specifically, measurements of the intrinsic H\$$\backslash$alpha\$ luminosity function derived from current low-resolution grism spectroscopy assuming a constant 29\% contamination of [NII] are likely over-estimated by factors of 2-4 at log(L) $>$ 43.0 and systematically under-estimated by \textasciitilde{}50 at log(L) $<$ 42.5 at redshifts z \textasciitilde{} 1.5.

  title = {Scale-Dependent Bias and Bispectrum in Neutrino Separate Universe Simulations},
  abstract = {Cosmic background neutrinos have a large velocity dispersion, which causes the evolution of long-wavelength density perturbations to depend on scale. This scale-dependent growth leads to the well-known suppression in the linear theory matter power spectrum that is used to probe neutrino mass. In this paper, we study the impact of long-wavelength density perturbations on small-scale structure formation. By performing separate universe simulations where the long-wavelength mode is absorbed into the local expansion, we measure the responses of the cold dark matter (CDM) power spectrum and halo mass function, which correspond to the squeezed-limit bispectrum and halo bias. We find that the scale-dependent evolution of the long-wavelength modes causes these quantities to depend on scale and provide simple expressions to model them in terms of scale and the amount of massive neutrinos. Importantly, this scale-dependent bias reduces the suppression in the linear halo power spectrum due to massive neutrinos by 13 and 26\% for objects of bias \$$\backslash$bar\{b\}=2\$ and \$$\backslash$bar\{b\} $\backslash$gg1\$, respectively. We demonstrate with high statistical significance that the scale-dependent halo bias \$\{$\backslash$it cannot\}\$ be modeled by the CDM and neutrino density transfer functions at the time when the halos are identified. This reinforces the importance of the temporal nonlocality of structure formation, especially when the growth is scale dependent.},

Thus, the mechanism(s) responsible for quenching central galaxies plays a crucial role in galaxy evolution as whole. We combine a high resolution cosmological \$N\$-body simulation with observed evolutionary trends of the "star formation main sequence," quiescent fraction, and stellar mass function at \$z $<$ 1\$ to construct a model that statistically tracks the star formation histories and quenching of central galaxies. Comparing this model to the distribution of central galaxy star formation rates in a group catalog of the SDSS Data Release 7, we constrain the timescales over which physical processes cease star formation in central galaxies. Over the stellar mass range \$10\^\{9.5\}\$ to \$10\^\{11\} $\backslash$mathrm\{M\}\_$\backslash$odot\$ we infer quenching e-folding times that span \$1.5\$ to \$0.5$\backslash$; $\backslash$mathrm\{Gyr\}\$ with more massive central galaxies quenching faster. For \$$\backslash$mathcal\{M\}\_* = 10\^\{10.5\}$\backslash$mathrm\{M\}\_$\backslash$odot\$, this implies a total migration time of \$$\backslash$sim 4\textasciitilde$\backslash$mathrm\{Gyrs\}\$ from the star formation main sequence to quiescence. Compared to satellites, central galaxies take \$$\backslash$sim 2\textasciitilde$\backslash$mathrm\{Gyrs\}\$ longer to quench their star formation, suggesting that different mechanisms are responsible for quenching centrals versus satellites. Finally, the central galaxy quenching timescale we infer provides key constraints for proposed star formation quenching mechanisms. Our timescale is generally consistent with gas depletion timescales predicted by quenching through strangulation. However, the exact physical mechanism(s) responsible for this still remain unclear.},

  abstract = {The analysis of galaxies on the SFR-M* plane is a powerful diagnostic for galaxy evolution at different cosmic times. We considered a sample of 24463 galaxies from the CANDELS/GOODS-S survey to conduct a detailed analysis of the SFR-M* relation at redshifts 0.5\$$\backslash$leqslant z$<$\$3 over more than three dex in stellar mass. To obtain SFR estimates, we utilized mid- and far-IR photometry when available, and rest-UV fluxes for all the other galaxies. We performed our analysis in different redshift bins, with two different methods: 1) a linear regression fitting of all star-forming galaxies, defined as those with specific star formation rates \$$\backslash$rm log\_\{10\}(sSFR/yr\^\{-1\}) $>$ -9.8\$, similarly to what is typically done in the literature; 2) a multi-Gaussian decomposition to identify the galaxy main sequence (MS), the starburst sequence and the quenched galaxy cloud. We found that the MS slope becomes flatter when higher stellar mass cuts are adopted, and that the apparent slope change observed at high masses depends on the SFR estimation method. In addition, the multi-Gaussian decomposition reveals the presence of a starburst population which increases towards low stellar masses and high redshifts. We found that starbursts make \textasciitilde{}5\% of all galaxies at z=0.5-1.0, while they account for \textasciitilde{}14\% of galaxies at 1$<$z$<$3 with log\$\_\{10\}(M\^\{*\})=\$8.25-11.25. We conclude that the dissection of the SFR-M* in multiple components over a wide range of stellar masses is necessary to understand the importance of the different modes of star formation through cosmic time.},

This secondary bias implies that no single halo property encompasses all the spatial clustering information of the halo population. The mean values of some halo properties depend on their halo's distance to a more massive neighbor. Halo samples selected by having high values of one of these properties therefore inherit a neighbor bias such that they are much more likely to be close to a much more massive neighbor. This neighbor bias largely accounts for the secondary bias seen in halos binned by mass and split by concentration or age. However, halos binned by other mass-like properties still show a secondary bias even when the neighbor bias is removed. The secondary bias of halos selected by their spin behaves differently than that for other halo properties, suggesting that the origin of the spin bias is different than of other secondary biases.},

  shorttitle = {Galaxy {{Cluster Mass Reconstruction Project}}},
  abstract = {With the advent of wide-field cosmological surveys, we are approaching samples of hundreds of thousands of galaxy clusters. While such large numbers will help reduce statistical uncertainties, the control of systematics in cluster masses becomes ever more crucial. Here we examine the effects of an important source of systematic uncertainty in galaxy-based cluster mass estimation techniques: the presence of significant dynamical substructure. Dynamical substructure manifests as dynamically distinct subgroups in phase-space, indicating an 'unrelaxed' state. This issue affects around a quarter of clusters in a generally selected sample. We employ a set of mock clusters whose masses have been measured homogeneously with commonly-used galaxy-based mass estimation techniques (kinematic, richness, caustic, radial methods). We use these to study how the relation between observationally estimated and true cluster mass depends on the presence of substructure, as identified by various popular diagnostics. We find that the scatter for an ensemble of clusters does not increase dramatically for clusters with dynamical substructure. However, we find a systematic bias for all methods, such that clusters with significant substructure have higher measured masses than their relaxed counterparts. This bias depends on cluster mass: the most massive clusters are largely unaffected by the presence of significant substructure, but masses are significantly overestimated for lower mass clusters, by \$$\backslash$sim10$\backslash$\%\$ at \$10\^\{14\}\$ and \$$\backslash$geq20$\backslash$\%\$ for \$$\backslash$leq10\^\{13.5\}\$. The use of cluster samples with different levels of substructure can, therefore, bias certain cosmological parameters up to a level comparable to the typical uncertainties in current cosmological studies.},

We obtain dust-corrected SFRs by fitting the GALEX (UV) and SDSS (optical) photometry to a library of population synthesis models that include dust attenuation. For star-forming galaxies, our UV-based SFRs compare remarkably well with those derived from SDSS H alpha. Deviations from perfect agreement between these two methods are due to differences in the dust attenuation estimates. In contrast to H alpha, UV provides reliable SFRs for galaxies with weak or no H alpha emission, and where H alpha is contaminated with an emission from an AGN. We use full-SED SFRs to calibrate a simple prescription that uses GALEX UV magnitudes to produce good SFRs for normal star-forming galaxies. The specific SFR is considered as a function of stellar mass for (1) star-forming galaxies with no AGN, (2) those hosting an AGN, and for (3) galaxies without H alpha emission. We find that the three have distinct star formation histories, with AGN lying intermediate between the star-forming and the quiescent galaxies. Normal star forming galaxies (without an AGN) lie on a relatively narrow linear sequence. Remarkably, galaxies hosting a strong AGN appear to represent the massive continuation of this sequence. Weak AGN, while also massive, have lower SFR, sometimes extending to the realm of quiescent galaxies. We propose an evolutionary sequence for massive galaxies that smoothly connects normal star-forming galaxies to quiescent (red sequence) galaxies via strong and weak AGN. We confirm that some galaxies with no H alpha emission show signs of SF in the UV. We derive a UV-based cosmic SFR density at z=0.1 with smaller total error than previous measurements (abridged).},

star formation rates (SFRs) and lie on the ‘red sequence' than central
(‘field') galaxies. Using galaxy group/cluster catalogues from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7, together with a high-resolution,
cosmological N-body simulation to track satellite orbits, we examine the
star formation histories and quenching time-scales of satellites of
Mstar $>$ 5 \texttimes{} 109 M$\odot$ at z
$\approx$ 0. We first explore satellite infall histories: group preprocessing
and ejected orbits are critical aspects of satellite evolution, and
properly accounting for these, satellite infall typically occurred at z
\texttildelow{} 0.5, or \texttildelow{}5 Gyr ago. To obtain accurate initial conditions
for the SFRs of satellites at their time of first infall, we construct
an empirical parametrization for the evolution of central galaxy SFRs
and quiescent fractions. With this, we constrain the importance and
efficiency of satellite quenching as a function of satellite and host
halo mass, finding that satellite quenching is the dominant process for
building up all quiescent galaxies at Mstar $<$
1010 M$\odot$. We then constrain satellite star
formation histories, finding a ‘delayed-then-rapid' quenching scenario:
satellite SFRs evolve unaffected for 2-4 Gyr after infall, after which
star formation quenches rapidly, with an e-folding time of $<$0.8 Gyr.
These quenching time-scales are shorter for more massive satellites but
do not depend on host halo mass: the observed increase in the satellite
quiescent fraction with halo mass arises simply because of satellites
quenching in a lower mass group prior to infall (group preprocessing),
which is responsible for up to half of quenched satellites in massive
clusters. Because of the long time delay before quenching starts,
satellites experience significant stellar mass growth after infall,
nearly identical to central galaxies. This fact provides key physical
insight into the subhalo abundance matching method.},

logM*. The range of log(SFR) remains constant to z$>$1,
while the MS as a whole moves to higher SFR as z increases. The range of
the SFR along the MS constrains the amplitude of episodic variations of
SF and the effect of mergers on the SFR. Typical galaxies spend
\textasciitilde{}67\%(95\%) of their lifetime since z=1 within a factor of $<$\textasciitilde{}2(4) of
their average SFR at a given M* and z. The dominant mode of

average SFR in most individual galaxies, not a decreasing frequency of
starburst episodes, or a decreasing factor by which SFRs are enhanced in
starbursts. LIRGs at z\textasciitilde{}1 seem to mostly reflect the high SFR typical for
massive galaxies at that epoch. The smooth MS may reflect that the same

characteristic stellar mass m* = 6.7 \texttimes{}
1010Msolar and with faint-end slope $\alpha$ =
-1.155. For a standard cosmology and a standard stellar initial mass function, only 3.5 per cent of the baryons in the low-redshift Universe are locked up in stars. The projected autocorrelation function of stellar mass is robustly and precisely determined for rp $<$ 30h-1Mpc. Over the range 10h-1kpc $<$
rp $<$ 10h-1Mpc, it is extremely well represented by a power law. The corresponding three-dimensional autocorrelation function is $\xi$*(r) = (r/6.1h-1Mpc)-1.84.
Relative to the dark matter, the bias of the stellar mass distribution is approximately constant on large scales, but varies by a factor of 5 for rp $<$ 1h-1Mpc. This behaviour is
approximately but not perfectly reproduced by current models for galaxy formation in the concordance $\Lambda$cold dark matter cosmology.
Detailed comparison suggests that a fluctuation amplitude
$\sigma$8 \textasciitilde{} 0.8 is preferred to the somewhat larger value

The key components of these high accuracy simulations are: precise initial conditions, very large simulation volumes, sufficient mass resolution, and accurate time stepping. This paper is the first in a series of three, with the final aim to provide a high-accuracy prediction scheme for the nonlinear matter power spectrum.},

  abstract = {The power spectrum of density fluctuations is a foundational source of cosmological information. Precision cosmological probes targeted primarily at investigations of dark energy require accurate theoretical determinations of the power spectrum in the nonlinear regime. To exploit the observational power of future cosmological surveys, accuracy demands on the theory are at the one percent level or better. Numerical simulations are currently the only way to produce sufficiently error-controlled predictions for the power spectrum. The very high computational cost of (precision) N-body simulations is a major obstacle to obtaining predictions in the nonlinear regime, while scanning over cosmological parameters. Near-future observations, however, are likely to provide a meaningful constraint only on constant dark energy equation of state 'wCDM' cosmologies. In this paper we demonstrate that a limited set of only 37 cosmological models -- the "Coyote Universe" suite -- can be used to predict the nonlinear matter power spectrum at the required accuracy over a prior parameter range set by cosmic microwave background observations. This paper is the second in a series of three, with the final aim to provide a high-accuracy prediction scheme for the nonlinear matter power spectrum for wCDM cosmologies.},

  abstract = {Many of the most exciting questions in astrophysics and cosmology, including the majority of observational probes of dark energy, rely on an understanding of the nonlinear regime of structure formation. In order to fully exploit the information available from this regime and to extract cosmological constraints, accurate theoretical predictions are needed. Currently such predictions can only be obtained from costly, precision numerical simulations. This paper is the third in a series aimed at constructing an accurate calibration of the nonlinear mass power spectrum on Mpc scales for a wide range of currently viable cosmological models, including dark energy. The first two papers addressed the numerical challenges, and the scheme by which an interpolator was built from a carefully chosen set of cosmological models. In this paper we introduce the "Coyote Univers"' simulation suite which comprises nearly 1,000 N-body simulations at different force and mass resolutions, spanning 38 wCDM cosmologies. This large simulation suite enables us to construct a prediction scheme, or emulator, for the nonlinear matter power spectrum accurate at the percent level out to k\textasciitilde{}1 h/Mpc. We describe the construction of the emulator, explain the tests performed to ensure its accuracy, and discuss how the central ideas may be extended to a wider range of cosmological models and applications.

  abstract = {Modern sky surveys are returning precision measurements of cosmological statistics such as weak lensing shear correlations, the distribution of galaxies, and cluster abundance. To fully exploit these observations, theorists must provide predictions that are at least as accurate as the measurements, as well as robust estimates of systematic errors that are inherent to the modeling process. In the nonlinear regime of structure formation, this challenge can only be overcome by developing a large-scale, multi-physics simulation capability covering a range of cosmological models and astrophysical processes. As a first step to achieving this goal, we have recently developed a prediction scheme for the matter power spectrum (a so-called emulator), accurate at the 1\% level out to k\textasciitilde{}1/Mpc and z=1 for wCDM cosmologies based on a set of high-accuracy N-body simulations. It is highly desirable to increase the range in both redshift and wavenumber and to extend the reach in cosmological parameter space. To make progress in this direction, while minimizing computational cost, we present a strategy that maximally re-uses the original simulations. We demonstrate improvement over the original spatial dynamic range by an order of magnitude, reaching k\textasciitilde{}10 h/Mpc, a four-fold increase in redshift coverage, to z=4, and now include the Hubble parameter as a new independent variable. To further the range in k and z, a new set of nested simulations run at modest cost is added to the original set. The extension in h is performed by including perturbation theory results within a multi-scale procedure for building the emulator. This economical methodology still gives excellent error control, \textasciitilde{}5\% near the edges of the domain of applicability of the emulator. A public domain code for the new emulator is released as part of the work presented in this paper.},

Even though the assumption of a Gaussian likelihood is motivated by the central limit theorem, we discuss that it leads to Fisher information content that violates the Cram$\backslash$'er-Rao bound if used consistently, owing to independent but artificial information from the parameter-dependent covariance matrix. At any fixed multipole, this artificial term is shown to become dominant in the case of a large number of correlated fields. While the distribution of the estimators does indeed tend to a Gaussian with a large number of modes, it is shown, however, that its Fisher information content does not, in the sense that their covariance matrix never carries independent information content, precisely because of the non-Gaussian shape of the distribution. In this light, we discuss the use of parameter-dependent covariance matrices with Gaussian likelihoods for parameter inference from two-point statistics. As a rule of thumb, Gaussian likelihoods should always be used with a covariance matrix fixed in parameter space, since only this guarantees that conservative information content is assigned to the observables, and at the same time prevents biases appearing.},

  abstract = {We present a Bayesian hierarchical inference formalism to study the relation between the properties of dark matter halos and those of their central galaxies using weak gravitational lensing. Unlike traditional methods, this technique does not resort to stacking the weak lensing signal in bins, and thus allows for a more efficient use of the information content in the data. Our method is particularly useful for constraining scaling relations between two or more galaxy properties and dark matter halo mass, and can also be used to constrain the intrinsic scatter in these scaling relations. We show that, if observational scatter is not properly accounted for, the traditional stacking method can produce biased results when exploring correlations between multiple galaxy properties and halo mass. For example, this bias can affect studies of the joint correlation between galaxy mass, halo mass, and galaxy size, or galaxy color. In contrast, our method easily and efficiently handles the intrinsic and observational scatter in multiple galaxy properties and halo mass. We test our method on mocks with varying degrees of complexity. We find that we can recover the mean halo mass and concentration, each with a \$0.1\$ dex accuracy, and the intrinsic scatter in halo mass with a \$0.05\$ dex accuracy. In its current version, our method will be most useful for studying the weak lensing signal around central galaxies in groups and clusters, as well as massive galaxies samples with \$$\backslash$log\{M\_*\} $>$ 11\$, which have low satellite fractions.},

  abstract = {We study radial profiles in H\$$\backslash$alpha\$ equivalent width and specific star formation rate (sSFR) derived from spatially-resolved SDSS-IV MaNGA spectroscopy to gain insight on the physical mechanisms that suppress star formation and determine a galaxy's location in the SFR-\$$\backslash$rm M\_$\backslash$star\$ diagram. Even within the star-forming blue cloud, the typical sSFR profile depends on stellar mass. Flat radial profiles are observed for \$$\backslash$rm log(M\_$\backslash$star/M\_$\backslash$odot ) $<$ 10.5\$, while star-forming galaxies of higher mass show a significant decrease in sSFR in the central regions, a likely consequence of both larger bulges and an inside-out growth history. Our primary focus is the green valley where, at all masses, we find sSFR profiles that are suppressed with respect to normal star-forming galaxies at all galactocentric distances out to 2 effective radii. The responsible quenching mechanism therefore appears to affect the entire galaxy, not simply an expanding central region. However, those galaxies in which central star formation has shut down (classified spectroscopically as central low-ionisation emission-line regions, or cLIERs) show an even stronger suppression in sSFR across the whole disc. These systems are also more suppressed than green valley galaxies with residual, central star-formation. In fact, compared to structural parameters like \$$\backslash$Sigma\_1\$ (the mass surface density within 1 kpc), central quiescence is a stronger predictor of ongoing sSFR suppression at fixed \$$\backslash$rm M\_$\backslash$star\$. The green valley hosts both quiescent bulges and strongly suppressed star forming discs, supporting a scenario in which a slow quenching process affects the entire galaxy, and not just the central regions.},

Star formation rates are calculated using a two-step process, exploiting H\$\_$\backslash$alpha\$ in star-forming regions and \$D\_n4000\$ in zones identified as AGN/LI(N)ER or lineless according to the BPT diagram. This enables a complete view of how radial profiles of specific star formation rate depend on stellar mass, galaxy structure and environment, providing valuable clues about the nature of both secular and environmental quenching processes. We report on the existence of ‘Centrally Suppressed' galaxies, which have lower SSFR in their cores compared to their disks. The profiles of centrally suppressed and unsuppressed galaxies are distributed in a bimodal way, with very few galaxies having intermediate profile shapes. Galaxies with large stellar masses and central velocity dispersions are much more likely to be centrally-suppressed than low-mass galaxies, a result linked to their morphology and the presence of AGN/LI(N)ER like emission. Centrally suppressed galaxies also display lower star formation at all radii compared to unsuppressed galaxies. Independent of galaxy type, galaxies identified as satellites in larger dark matter halos have noticeably lower SSFR at outer radii compared to central galaxies. This uniform suppression could be a signal of the stripping of hot gas reservoirs through a process like strangulation. We find that satellites are not more likely to be suppressed in their cores than centrals, indicating that core suppression is an entirely secular process. We find no secondary correlation between the local environment density and the profiles of star formation rate surface density.},

This assumption, in detail, cannot be correct. Likelihood free inferences such as Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) relax these restrictions and make inference possible without making any assumptions on the likelihood. Instead ABC relies on a forward generative model of the data and a metric for measuring the distance between the model and data. In this work, we demonstrate that ABC is feasible for LSS parameter inference by using it to constrain parameters of the halo occupation distribution (HOD) model for populating dark matter halos with galaxies. Using specific implementation of ABC supplemented with Population Monte Carlo importance sampling, a generative forward model using HOD, and a distance metric based on galaxy number density, two-point correlation function, and galaxy group multiplicity function, we constrain the HOD parameters of mock observation generated from selected "true" HOD parameters. The parameter constraints we obtain from ABC are consistent with the "true" HOD parameters, demonstrating that ABC can be reliably used for parameter inference in LSS. Furthermore, we compare our ABC constraints to constraints we obtain using a pseudo-likelihood function of Gaussian form with MCMC and find consistent HOD parameter constraints. Ultimately our results suggest that ABC can and should be applied in parameter inference for LSS analyses.},

  abstract = {Adopting the framework of the Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD), we investigate the ability of galaxy clustering measurements to simultaneously constrain cosmological parameters and galaxy bias. Starting with a fiducial cosmological model and galaxy HOD, we calculate spatial clustering observables on a range of length and mass scales, dynamical clustering observables that depend on galaxy peculiar velocities, and the galaxy-matter cross-correlation measurable by weak lensing. We then change one or more cosmological parameters and use chi\^2-minimization to find the galaxy HOD that best reproduces the original clustering. Our parameterization of the HOD incorporates a flexible relation between galaxy occupation numbers and halo mass and allows spatial and velocity bias of galaxies within dark matter halos. Despite this flexibility, we find that changes to the HOD cannot mask substantial changes to the matter density Omega\_m, the matter clustering amplitude sigma\_8, or the shape parameter Gamma of the linear matter power spectrum -- cosmology and bias are not degenerate. With the conservative assumption of 10\% fractional errors, the set of observables considered here can provide \textasciitilde{}10\% (1 sigma) constraints on sigma\_8, Omega\_m, and Gamma, using galaxy clustering data ALONE. The combination sigma\_8*Omega\_m\^0.75 is constrained to \textasciitilde{}5\%. In combination with traditional methods that focus on large scale structure in the "perturbative" regime, HOD modeling can greatly amplify the cosmological power of galaxy redshift surveys by taking advantage of high-precision clustering measurements at small and intermediate scales (from sub-Mpc to \textasciitilde{}20Mpc/h). At the same time, the inferred constraints on the galaxy HOD provide valuable tests of galaxy formation theory.},

The majority (85 per cent) of these quenched galaxies appear to reside in a group environment. We find 6 galaxies in our sample that appear to have an active AGN that is preventing on-going star-formation; this is the first time such a feedback mechanism has been observed in this mass range. Interestingly, five of these six galaxies have an ionised gas component that is kinematically offset from their stellar component, suggesting the gas is either recently accreted or outflowing. We hypothesise these six galaxies are low-mass equivalents to the "red geysers" observed in more massive galaxies. Of the other 62 galaxies in the sample, we find 8 do appear for have some low-level, residual star formation, or emission from hot, evolved stars. The remaining galaxies in our sample have no detectable ionised gas emission throughout their structures, consistent with them being quenched. This work shows the potential for understanding the detailed physical properties of dwarf galaxies through spatially resolved spectroscopy.},

  title = {Stellar Mass Functions and Implications for a Variable {{IMF}}},
  abstract = {Spatially resolved kinematics of nearby galaxies has shown that the ratio of dynamical- to stellar population-based estimates of the mass of a galaxy (M\$\_*\^\{JAM\}\$ / M\$\_*\$) correlates with \$$\backslash$sigma\_e\$, the light-weighted velocity dispersion within its half-light radius, if M\$\_*\$ is estimated using the same Initial Mass Function (IMF) for all galaxies. This correlation may indicate that, in fact, the IMF is more bottom-heavy or dwarf-rich for galaxies with large \$$\backslash$sigma\$. We use this correlation to estimate a dynamical or IMF-corrected stellar mass, M\$\_*\^\{$\backslash$alpha JAM\}\$, from M\$\_*\$ and \$$\backslash$sigma\_e\$ for a sample of 6x10\$\^5\$ SDSS galaxies for which spatially resolved kinematics is not available. We also compute the ‘virial' mass estimate \$k(n,R) R\_e $\backslash$sigma\_R\^2/G\$, where \$n\$ is the Sersic index, in the SDSS and ATLAS-3D samples. We show that an \$n\$-dependent correction must be applied to the \$k(n,R)\$ values provided by Prugniel \& Simien (1997). Our analysis also shows that the shape of the velocity dispersion profile in the ATLAS-3D sample varies weakly with \$n\$: \$$\backslash$sigma\_R/$\backslash$sigma\_e=(R/R\_e)\^\{-$\backslash$gamma(n)\}\$. The resulting stellar mass functions, based on M\$\_*\^\{$\backslash$alpha JAM\}\$ and the recalibrated virial mass, are in good agreement. If the M\$\_*\^\{$\backslash$alpha JAM\}\$ / M\$\_*\$ - \$$\backslash$sigma\_e\$ correlation is indeed due to the IMF, then our \$$\backslash$Phi\$(M\$\_*\^\{$\backslash$alpha JAM\}\$) is the first estimate of the stellar mass function in which \$$\backslash$sigma\_e\$-dependent variations in the IMF across the population have been accounted for. Using a Fundamental Plane based observational proxy for \$$\backslash$sigma\_e\$ produces comparable results. The use of direct measurements for estimating the IMF-dependent stellar mass is prohibitively expensive for a large sample of galaxies. Our analysis should enable a more accurate census of the mass in stars, especially at high redshift, at a fraction of the cost. Our results are provided in tabular form.},

  abstract = {We investigate radial gradients in the recent star formation history (SFH) using 1917 galaxies with \$0.01$<$z$<$0.14\$ and integral-field spectroscopy from the ongoing MaNGA survey. For each galaxy, we obtain two-dimensional maps and radial profiles for three spectroscopically-measured parameters that are sensitive to the recent SFH: D\$\_n\$(4000) (the 4000$\backslash$AA$\backslash$ break), EW(H\$$\backslash$delta\_A\$) (equivalent width of the H\$$\backslash$delta\$ absorption line), and EW(H\$$\backslash$alpha\$) (equivalent width of the H\$$\backslash$alpha\$ emission line). We find the majority of the spaxels in these galaxies are consistent with models with continuously declining star formation rate, indicating that starbursts occur rarely in local galaxies. We classify the galaxies into three classes: fully star-forming (SF), partly quenched (PQ) and totally quenched (TQ), according to the fraction of quenched area within 1.5 times the effective radius, \$f\_Q(1.5R\_e)\$. We find that galaxies less massive than \$10\^\{10\}\$M\$\_\{$\backslash$odot\}\$ present at most weak radial gradients in all the diagnostic parameters. In contrast, galaxies with stellar mass above \$10\^\{10\}\$M\$\_\{$\backslash$odot\}\$ present significant gradients in all the three diagnostic parameters if classified as SF or PQ, but show weak gradients in D\$\_n\$(4000) and EW(H\$$\backslash$delta\_A\$) and no gradients in EW(H\$$\backslash$alpha\$) if in the TQ class. This implies the existence of a critical stellar mass, at \$$\backslash$sim10\^\{10\}\$M\$\_\{$\backslash$odot\}\$, above which the star formation in a galaxy gets shutdown from the inside out. Galaxies tend to evolve synchronously from inner to outer regions before their mass reaches the critical value. We have further divided the sample at fixed mass by both bulge-to-total luminosity ratio and morphological type, finding that our conclusions hold regardless of these factors: it appears that the presence of a central dense object is not a driving parameter, but rather a byproduct of the star formation cessation process.},

local universe, identified by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and dark
matter halos and their constituent substructures in the $\Lambda$-cold
dark matter model using WMAP7 cosmological parameters. Predictions for
the abundance and clustering properties of dark matter halos, and the
relationship between dark matter hosts and substructures, are based on a
high-resolution cosmological simulation, the Bolshoi simulation. We
associate galaxies with dark matter halos and subhalos using subhalo
abundance matching, and perform a comprehensive analysis which
investigates the underlying assumptions of this technique including (1)
which halo property is most closely associated with galaxy stellar
masses and luminosities, (2) how much scatter is in this relationship,
and (3) how much subhalos can be stripped before their galaxies are
destroyed. The models are jointly constrained by new measurements of the
projected two-point galaxy clustering and the observed conditional
stellar mass function of galaxies in groups. We find that an abundance
matching model that associates galaxies with the peak circular velocity
of their halos is in good agreement with the data, when scatter of 0.20
$\pm$ 0.03 dex in stellar mass at a given peak velocity is included.
This confirms the theoretical expectation that the stellar mass of
galaxies is tightly correlated with the potential wells of their dark
matter halos before they are impacted by larger structures. The data put
tight constraints on the satellite fraction of galaxies as a function of
galaxy stellar mass and on the scatter between halo and galaxy
properties, and rule out several alternative abundance matching models
that have been considered. This will yield important constraints for
galaxy formation models, and also provides encouraging indications that
the galaxy-halo connection can be modeled with sufficient fidelity for
future precision studies of the dark universe.},

  abstract = {Using data from the COSMOS survey, we perform the first joint analysis 
of galaxy-galaxy weak lensing, galaxy spatial clustering, and galaxy
number densities. Carefully accounting for sample variance and for
scatter between stellar and halo mass, we model all three observables
simultaneously using a novel and self-consistent theoretical framework.
Our results provide strong constraints on the shape and redshift
evolution of the stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) from z = 0.2 to z
= 1. At low stellar mass, we find that halo mass scales as Mh
vpropM 0.46 * and that this scaling does not
evolve significantly with redshift from z = 0.2 to z = 1. The slope of
the SHMR rises sharply at M * $>$ 5 \texttimes{} 1010
M $\odot$ and as a consequence, the stellar mass of a central
galaxy becomes a poor tracer of its parent halo mass. We show that the
dark-to-stellar ratio, Mh /M *, varies from low to
high masses, reaching a minimum of Mh /M * \textasciitilde{} 27 at
M * = 4.5 \texttimes{} 1010 M $\odot$ and
Mh = 1.2 \texttimes{} 1012 M $\odot$. This
minimum is important for models of galaxy formation because it marks the
mass at which the accumulated stellar growth of the central galaxy has
been the most efficient. We describe the SHMR at this minimum in terms
of the "pivot stellar mass," M piv *, the "pivot
halo mass," M piv h , and the "pivot ratio,"
(Mh /M *)piv. Thanks to a homogeneous
analysis of a single data set spanning a large redshift range, we report
the first detection of mass downsizing trends for both M piv
 h and M piv *. The pivot stellar mass
decreases from M piv * = 5.75 $\pm$ 0.13
\texttimes{} 1010 M $\odot$ at z = 0.88 to M
piv * = 3.55 $\pm$ 0.17 \texttimes{} 1010
M $\odot$ at z = 0.37. Intriguingly, however, the corresponding
evolution of M piv h leaves the pivot ratio
constant with redshift at (Mh /M *)piv
\textasciitilde{} 27. We use simple arguments to show how this result raises the
possibility that star formation quenching may ultimately depend on
Mh /M * and not simply on Mh , as is
commonly assumed. We show that simple models with such a dependence
naturally lead to downsizing in the sites of star formation. Finally, we
discuss the implications of our results in the context of popular
quenching models, including disk instabilities and active galactic
nucleus feedback.

Using galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we investigate the halo mass-luminosity relation (MLR) and the halo mass-stellar mass relation (MSR) of central galaxies. In particular, we focus on the dependence of these scaling relations on the colour of the central galaxy. We find that red central galaxies on average occupy more massive haloes than blue central galaxies of the same luminosity. However, at fixed stellar mass there is no appreciable difference in the average halo mass of red and blue centrals, especially for M*$\lessequivlnt$ 1010.5
h-2 M$\odot$. This indicates that stellar mass is a better indicator of halo mass than luminosity. Nevertheless, we find that the scatter in halo masses at fixed stellar mass is non-negligible for both red and blue centrals. It increases as a function of stellar mass for red centrals but shows a fairly constant behaviour for blue centrals. We compare the scaling relations obtained in this paper with results from other independent studies of satellite kinematics, with results from a SDSS galaxy group catalog, from galaxy-galaxy weak lensing measurements and from subhalo abundance matching studies. Overall, these different techniques yield MLRs and MSRs in fairly good agreement with each other (typically within a factor of 2), indicating that we are converging on an accurate and reliable description of the galaxy-dark matter connection. We briefly discuss some of the remaining discrepancies among the various methods.},

The conditional stellar mass function (CSMF), which
describes the stellar distribution of galaxies in halos of a given mass for central and satellite galaxies can be well modeled with a log-normal distribution and a modified Schechter form, respectively. On average, there are about three times as many central galaxies as satellites. Among the satellite population, there are in general more red galaxies than blue ones. For the central population, the luminosity function is dominated by red galaxies at the massive end, and by blue galaxies at the low-mass end. At the very low mass end (M * lsim
109 h -2 M sun), however, there is a marked increase in the number of red centrals. We speculate that these galaxies are located close to large halos so that their star formation is truncated by the large-scale environments. The stellar mass function of galaxy groups is well described by a double power law, with a characteristic stellar mass at \textasciitilde{}4 \texttimes{} 1010 h

stellar mass-halo mass (SM-HM) relation, with rigorous consideration of
uncertainties. Our analysis focuses on results from the abundance
matching technique, which assumes that every dark matter halo or subhalo
above a specific mass threshold hosts one galaxy. We provide a robust
estimate of the SM-HM relation for 0 $<$ z $<$ 1 and discuss the
quantitative effects of uncertainties in observed galaxy stellar mass
functions (including stellar mass estimates and counting uncertainties),
halo mass functions (including cosmology and uncertainties from
substructure), and the abundance matching technique used to link
galaxies to halos (including scatter in this connection). Our analysis
results in a robust estimate of the SM-HM relation and its evolution
from z = 0 to z = 4. The shape and the evolution are well constrained
for z $<$ 1. The largest uncertainties at these redshifts are due to
stellar mass estimates (0.25 dex uncertainty in normalization); however,
failure to account for scatter in stellar masses at fixed halo mass can
lead to errors of similar magnitude in the SM-HM relation for central
galaxies in massive halos. We also investigate the SM-HM relation to z =
4, although the shape of the relation at higher redshifts remains fairly
unconstrained when uncertainties are taken into account. We find that
the integrated star formation at a given halo mass peaks at 10\%-20\% of
available baryons for all redshifts from 0 to 4. This peak occurs at a
halo mass of 7 \texttimes{} 1011 M sun at z = 0 and
this mass increases by a factor of 5 to z = 4. At lower and higher
masses, star formation is substantially less efficient, with stellar
mass scaling as M * \textasciitilde{} M 2.3 h at low
masses and M * \textasciitilde{} M 0.29 h at high
masses. The typical stellar mass for halos with mass less than
1012 M sun has increased by 0.3-0.45 dex for halos

Under the assumption that the likelihood is a Gaussian distribution, the Jeffreys prior is a constant, i.e. flat. However, if one parameter is constrained by physical considerations, the Gaussian approximation fails and the flat prior is no longer the Jeffreys prior. In this paper we compute the correct Jeffreys prior for a multivariate normal distribution constrained in one dimension, and we apply it to the sum of neutrino masses \$$\backslash$Sigma m\_$\backslash$nu\$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio \$r\$. We find that one-dimensional marginalised posteriors for these two parameters change considerably and that the 68\% and 95\% Bayesian upper limits increase by 9\% and 4\% respectively for \$$\backslash$Sigma m\_$\backslash$nu\$ and 22\% and 3\% for \$r\$. Adding the prior to an existing chain can be done as a trivial importance sampling in the final step of the analysis proces.},

  shorttitle = {Massive Neutrinos in Nonlinear Large Scale Structure},
  abstract = {A consistent formulation to incorporate massive neutrinos in the perturbation theory of the effective CDM+baryons fluid is introduced. In this formulation all linear k dependence in the growth functions of CDM+baryons perturbations, as well as all consequent additional mode coupling at higher orders, are taken into account to any desirable accuracy. Our formulation regards the neutrino fraction, which is constant in time after the non-relativistic transition of neutrinos, and much smaller than unity, as the coupling constant of the theory. Then the "bare" perturbations are those in the massless neutrino case when the neutrino fraction vanishes, and we consider the backreaction corrections due to the gravitational coupling of neutrinos. We derive the general equations for the "bare" perturbations, and backrecation corrections. Then, by employing exact time evolution with the proper analytic Green's function we explicitly derive the leading backreaction effect, and find precise agreement at the linear level. We proceed to compute the second order beackreaction correction, and derive the leading order matter bispectrum in the presence of massive neutrinos, suggesting the squeezed limit of the matter bispectrum as a sensitive probe of neutrino mass. Notably, the generic neutrino fraction formulation in this work may be similarly applied for the consistent inclusion of massive neutrinos within any perturbative approach.},

  abstract = {We develop a higher-order perturbation theory for large-scale structure formation involving a free-streaming hot or warm dark matter species. We focus on the case of mixed cold dark matter and massive neutrinos, although our approach is applicable also to a single warm dark matter species. In order to capture the suppressed growth of neutrino density perturbations on small scales, we account for the full momentum dependence of the phase space distribution using the Vlaslov equation, and derive from it a formal closed-form nonlinear equation for the neutrino density. Using a systematic perturbative expansion of this equation we compute high-order corrections to the neutrino density contrast without the explicit need to track the perturbed neutrino momentum distribution. We calculate the leading-order total matter bispectrum for several neutrino masses. Using our result as a benchmark, we test the accuracy of the fluid approximation and a linear approximation used in perturbative and N-body analyses, as well as a new hybrid approach that combines the exact linear evolution with the nonlinear structure of the fluid equations. Aiming at \$$\backslash$lesssim1\%\$ accuracy, we find that the total matter bispectrum with a low neutrino mass m=0.046 eV can be reproduced by all but the fluid approximation, while for larger neutrino masses m=0.46-0.93 eV only the hybrid approach has the desired accuracy on a large range of scales. This result serves as a cautionary note that approximate nonlinear models of neutrino clustering that reproduce the gross features of some observables may not suffice for precision calculations, nor are they guaranteed to apply to other observables. All of the approximation schemes fail to reproduce the bispectrum of the neutrino density perturbations at better than 20\% accuracy across all scales, indicating that an exact treatment of nonlinear neutrino perturbations is necessary.},

  abstract = {In hierarchical structure formation, dark matter halos that merge with larger halos can persist as subhalos. These subhalos are likely hosts of visible galaxies. While the dense halo environment rapidly strips subhalos of their dark mass, the compact luminous material can remain intact for some time, making the correspondence of galaxies with severely stripped subhalos unclear. Many galaxy evolution models assume that satellite galaxies eventually merge with their central galaxy, but this ignores the possibility of satellite tidal disruption. We use a high-resolution \$N\$-body simulation of cosmological volume to explore satellite galaxy merging/disruption criteria based on dark matter subhalo dynamics. We explore the impact that satellite merging/disruption has on the Halo Occupation Distribution and radial profile of the remnants. Using abundance matching to assign stellar mass/luminosity to subhalos, we compare with observed galaxy clustering, satellite fractions, cluster satellite luminosity functions, finding that subhalos reproduce well these observables on all scales. Our results imply that satellite subhalos corresponding to $>$0.2L* galaxies must be well-resolved down to 1-3\% of their mass at infall to robustly trace the galaxy population. We also explore a simple analytic model based on dynamical friction for satellite galaxy infall, finding good agreement with our subhalo catalog and observations.},

  abstract = {The cosmic accretion of both dark matter and baryons into halos is 
typically measured using some evolving virial relation, but recent work
suggests that most halo growth at late cosmic time (z$\lessequivlnt$ 2) is not
physical but is rather the by-product of an evolving virial radius
(``pseudo-evolution''). Using Omega25, a suite of cosmological
simulations that incorporate both dark matter and gas dynamics with
differing treatments of gas cooling, star formation, and thermal
feedback, we systematically explore the physics that governs cosmic
accretion into halos and their galaxies. Physically meaningful cosmic
accretion of both dark matter and baryons occurs at z$\greaterequivlnt$ 1 across our
halo mass range: \{M\}200\{\{m\}\}=\{10\}11-14
\{$\backslash$text\{\}\}\{M\}$\odot$ . However, dark matter, because it is
dissipationless, is deposited (in a time-average sense) at $\greaterequivlnt$
\{R\}200\{\{m\}\}(z) in a shell-like manner, such that dark matter
mass and density experience little-to-no physical growth at any radius
within a halo at z$\backslash$lt 1. In contrast, gas, because it is able to cool
radiatively, experiences significant accretion at all radii, at a rate
that roughly tracks the accretion rate at \{R\}200\{\{m\}\}, at all
redshifts. Infalling gas starts to decouple from dark matter at $\approx$ 2
\{R\}200\{\{m\}\} and continues to accrete to smaller radii until
the onset of strong angular-momentum support at $\approx$ 0.1
\{R\}200\{\{m\}\}. Thus, while the growth of dark matter is subject
to pseudo-evolution, the growth of baryons is not. The fact that the
accretion rate of gas on galactic scales tracks the accretion rate near
\{R\}200\{\{m\}\} provides insight into the tight relations between
the masses/sizes of galaxies and those of their host halos across cosmic
time.},

scatter of $\approx$0.2 dex. Such scaling is in remarkable agreement with the expectation of models that assume that galaxy sizes are controlled by halo angular momentum, r 1/2vprop$\lambda$R 200,
where $\lambda$ is the spin of galaxy parent halo. The scatter about the relation is comparable with the scatter expected from the distribution of $\lambda$. Moreover, I show that when the stellar and gas surface
density profiles of galaxies of different morphological types are rescaled by the radius rn = 0.015 R 200, the rescaled profiles follow approximately universal exponential (for late types) and de Vaucouleurs (for early types) form with scatter of only $\approx$30\%-50\% at R $\approx$ 1-3rn . Remarkably, both late- and
early-type galaxies have similar mean stellar surface density profiles at R $>$\textasciitilde{} 1rn . The main difference between their stellar distributions is thus at R $<$ rn . The results of this study imply that galaxy sizes and radial distribution of baryons are shaped primarily by properties of their parent halos and that the sizes of both late-type disks and early-type spheroids are controlled by halo angular momentum.},

(NYU-VAGC), a catalog of local galaxies (mostly below z\textasciitilde{}0.3) based on a
set of publicly released surveys matched to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS) Data Release 2. The photometric catalog consists of 693,319
galaxies, QSOs, and stars; 343,568 of these have redshift
determinations, mostly from the SDSS. Excluding areas masked by bright
stars, the photometric sample covers 3514 deg2, and the
spectroscopic sample covers 2627 deg2 (with about 85\%
completeness). Earlier, proprietary versions of this catalog have formed
the basis of many SDSS investigations of the power spectrum, correlation
function, and luminosity function of galaxies. Future releases will
follow future public releases of the SDSS. The catalog includes matches
to the Two Micron All Sky Survey Point Source Catalog and Extended
Source Catalog, the IRAS Point Source Catalog Redshift Survey, the
Two-Degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey, the Third Reference Catalogue
of Bright Galaxies, and the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty cm
survey. We calculate and compile derived quantities from the images and
spectra of the galaxies in the catalogs (for example, K-corrections and
structural parameters for the galaxies). The SDSS catalog presented here
is photometrically calibrated in a more consistent way than that
distributed by the SDSS Data Release 2 Archive Servers and is thus more
appropriate for large-scale structure statistics, reducing systematic
calibration errors across the sky from \textasciitilde{}2\% to \textasciitilde{}1\%. We include an
explicit description of the geometry of the catalog, including all
imaging and targeting information as a function of sky position.
Finally, we have performed eyeball quality checks on a large number of
objects in the catalog in order to flag errors (such as errors in
deblending). This catalog is complementary to the SDSS Archive Servers
in that NYU-VAGC's calibration, geometric description, and conveniently
small size are specifically designed for studying galaxy properties and
large-scale structure statistics using the SDSS spectroscopic catalog.

deg2 of imaging data, with most of the \textasciitilde{}2000 deg2 increment over the previous data release lying in regions of low Galactic latitude. The catalog contains five-band photometry for 357 million distinct objects. The survey also includes repeat photometry on a 120$^\circ$ long, 2fdg5 wide stripe along the celestial equator in the Southern Galactic Cap, with some regions covered by as many as 90 individual imaging runs. We include a co-addition of the best of these data, going roughly 2 mag fainter than the main survey over 250
deg2. The survey has completed spectroscopy over 9380 deg2 the spectroscopy is now complete over a large contiguous area of the Northern Galactic Cap, closing the gap that was present in previous data releases. There are over 1.6 million spectra in total, including 930,000 galaxies, 120,000 quasars, and 460,000 stars. The data release includes improved stellar photometry at low Galactic latitude. The astrometry has all been recalibrated with the second version of the USNO CCD Astrograph Catalog, reducing the rms statistical errors at the bright end to 45 milliarcseconds per coordinate. We further quantify a systematic error in bright galaxy photometry due to poor sky
determination; this problem is less severe than previously reported for the majority of galaxies. Finally, we describe a series of improvements to the spectroscopic reductions, including better flat fielding and improved wavelength calibration at the blue end, better processing of objects with extremely strong narrow emission lines, and an improved determination of stellar metallicities.},

  title = {Are {{Halo}} and {{Galaxy Formation Histories Correlated}}?},
  volume = {1107},
  abstract = {The properties of dark matter halos, including mass growth, correlate with larger scale environment at fixed mass, an effect known as assembly bias. However, whether this environmental dependence manifests itself in galaxy properties remains unclear. We apply a group-finding algorithm to DR7 of the SDSS to estimate the halo mass of each galaxy and to
decompose galaxies into those that exist at the centers of distinct halos and those that orbit as satellites within larger halos. Using the 4000-A break as a measure of star formation history, we examine the correlation between the quenched fraction of galaxies, f\_q, and
large-scale environment, rho. At all galaxy magnitudes, there is a positive, monotonic relationship between f\_q and rho. We use the group catalog to decompose this correlation into the contribution from central and satellite galaxies as a function of halo mass. Because satellites are more likely to be quenched than central galaxies, the observed f\_q-rho correlation is primarily due to variations of the halo mass function with environment, which causes a larger fraction of satellite galaxies at high rho. For low-mass central galaxies (Mgal $<$\textasciitilde{} 10\^10.0 Msol/h\^2), there is no correlation between f\_q and rho. These results are inconsistent with the strong assembly bias of dark matter halos seen in this mass regime if recent galaxy growth at all correlates with recent halo growth, as we demonstrate through a high resolution N-body simulation. We also find that the mean stellar age of quenched central galaxies is independent of rho at fixed Mgal, while the formation times of low mass halos vary significantly. We conclude that the processes that halt the star formation of low mass central galaxies are not correlated to the formation histories of their host halos, and old galaxies do not reside preferentially in old halos.

  abstract = {We review recent determinations of the present-day mass function (PDMF) and initial mass function (IMF) in various components of the
Galaxy-disk, spheroid, young, and globular clusters-and in conditions characteristic of early star formation. As a general feature, the IMF is found to depend weakly on the environment and to be well described by a power-law form for m$>$\textasciitilde{}1 Msolar and a lognormal form below, except possibly for early star formation conditions. The disk IMF for single objects has a characteristic mass around mc\textasciitilde{}0.08 Msolar and a variance in logarithmic mass $\sigma$\textasciitilde{}0.7,
whereas the IMF for multiple systems has mc\textasciitilde{}0.2
Msolar and $\sigma$\textasciitilde{}0.6. The extension of the single MF into the brown dwarf regime is in good agreement with present estimates of L- and T-dwarf densities and yields a disk brown dwarf number density comparable to the stellar one, nBD\textasciitilde{}n*\textasciitilde{}0.1
pc-3. The IMF of young clusters is found to be consistent with the disk field IMF, providing the same correction for unresolved binaries, confirming the fact that young star clusters and disk field stars represent the same stellar population. Dynamical effects, yielding depletion of the lowest mass objects, are found to become consequential for ages $>$\textasciitilde{}130 Myr. The spheroid IMF relies on much less robust
grounds. The large metallicity spread in the local subdwarf photometric sample, in particular, remains puzzling. Recent observations suggest that there is a continuous kinematic shear between the thick-disk population, present in local samples, and the genuine spheroid one. This enables us to derive only an upper limit for the spheroid mass density and IMF. Within all the uncertainties, the latter is found to be similar to the one derived for globular clusters and is well represented also by a lognormal form with a characteristic mass slightly larger than for the disk, mc\textasciitilde{}0.2-0.3 Msolar, excluding a significant population of brown dwarfs in globular clusters and in the spheroid. The IMF characteristic of early star formation at large redshift remains undetermined, but different observational constraints suggest that it does not extend below \textasciitilde{}1 Msolar. These results suggest a characteristic mass for star formation that decreases with time, from conditions prevailing at large redshift to conditions characteristic of the spheroid (or thick disk) to present-day conditions. These
conclusions, however, remain speculative, given the large uncertainties in the spheroid and early star IMF determinations.

These IMFs allow a reasonably robust determination of the Galactic present-day and initial stellar and brown dwarf contents. They also have important galactic implications beyond the Milky Way in yielding more accurate mass-to-light ratio determinations. The mass-to-light ratios obtained with the disk and the spheroid IMF yield values 1.8-1.4 times smaller than for a Salpeter IMF, respectively, in agreement with various recent dynamical determinations. This general IMF determination is examined in the context of star formation theory. None of the theories based on a Jeans-type mechanism, where fragmentation is due only to gravity, can fulfill all the observational constraints on star formation and predict a large number of substellar objects. On the other hand, recent numerical simulations of compressible turbulence, in particular in super-Alfv\'enic conditions, seem to reproduce both
qualitatively and quantitatively the stellar and substellar IMF and thus provide an appealing theoretical foundation. In this picture, star formation is induced by the dissipation of large-scale turbulence to smaller scales through radiative MHD shocks, producing filamentary structures. These shocks produce local nonequilibrium structures with large density contrasts, which collapse eventually in gravitationally bound objects under the combined influence of turbulence and gravity. The concept of a single Jeans mass is replaced by a distribution of local Jeans masses, representative of the lognormal probability density function of the turbulent gas. Objects below the mean thermal Jeans mass still have a possibility to collapse, although with a decreasing probability.

By comparing physical information extracted from the emission lines with continuum properties, we build up a picture of the nature of star-forming galaxies at z $<$ 0.2. We develop a
method for aperture correction using resolved imaging and show that our method takes out essentially all aperture bias in the star formation rate (SFR) estimates, allowing an accurate estimate of the total SFRs in galaxies. We determine the SFR density to be
1.915+0.02-0.01
(random)+0.14-0.42 (systematic)
h7010-2 Msolar yr-1
Mpc-3 at z= 0.1 (for a Kroupa initial mass function) and we study the distribution of star formation as a function of various physical parameters. The majority of the star formation in the
low-redshift Universe takes place in moderately massive galaxies (1010-1011 Msolar), typically in high surface brightness disc galaxies. Roughly 15 per cent of all star formation takes place in galaxies that show some sign of an active nucleus. About 20 per cent occurs in starburst galaxies. By focusing on the SFR per unit mass we show that the present to past average SFR, the Scalo b-parameter, is almost constant over almost three orders of magnitude in mass, declining only at M* $>$ 1010 Msolar. The volume averaged b parameter is
0.408+0.005-0.002
(random)+0.029-0.090
(systematic)h-170. We use this value to constrain the star formation history of the Universe. For the concordance
cosmology the present-day Universe is forming stars at at least 1/3 of its past average rate. For an exponentially declining cosmic star formation history this corresponds to a time-scale of
7+0.7-1.5 Gyr. In agreement with other work we find a correlation between b and morphological type, as well as a tight correlation between the 4000-\AA{}break (D4000) and b. We discuss how D4000 can be used to estimate b parameters for high-redshift galaxies.},

regardless of central satellite designation, exhibit a similar bimodal
SSFR distribution, with a strong break at SSFR $\approx$ 10-11
yr-1 and the same high SSFR peak; in no regime is there ever
an excess of galaxies in the 'green valley'. Satellite galaxies are
simply more likely to lie on the quenched ('red sequence') side of the
SSFR distribution. Furthermore, the satellite quenched fraction excess
above the field galaxy value is nearly independent of galaxy stellar
mass. An enhanced quenched fraction for satellites persists in groups
with halo masses down to 3 \texttimes{} 1011 M$\odot$ and
increases strongly with halo mass and towards halo centre. We find no
detectable quenching enhancement for galaxies beyond \texttildelow{}2
Rvir around massive clusters once these galaxies have been
decomposed into centrals and satellites. These trends imply that (1)
galaxies experience no significant environmental effects until they
cross within \texttildelow{}Rvir of a more massive host halo; (2)
after this, star formation in active satellites continues to evolve in
the same manner as active central galaxies for several Gyr; and (3) once
begun, satellite star formation quenching occurs rapidly. These results
place strong constraints on satellite-specific quenching mechanisms, as
we will discuss further in companion papers.},

clustering of groups/clusters, we show that central galaxies show
enhanced SFR quenching out to 2.5 virial radii beyond groups/clusters,
and we demonstrate that this extended environmental enhancement can be
explained simply by ‘ejected' satellite galaxies that orbit beyond their
host halo's virial radius. We show that ejected satellites typically
orbit for several Gyr beyond the virial radius before falling back in,
and thus they compose up to 40 per cent of all central galaxies near
groups/clusters. We show that a model in which ejected satellites
experience the same SFR quenching as satellites within a host halo can
explain essentially all environmental dependence of galaxy quenching.
Furthermore, ejected satellites (continue to) lose significant halo
mass, an effect that is potentially observable via gravitational
lensing. The SFRs/colours and stellar-to-halo masses of ejected
satellites highlight the importance of environmental history and present
challenges to models of galaxy occupation that ignore such history.},

the fidelity of group catalogue inferred statistics, we run three
different group finders used in the literature over a mock that includes
galaxy colours in a realistic manner. Overall, the resulting mock group
catalogues are remarkably similar, and most colour-dependent statistics
are recovered with reasonable accuracy. However, it is also clear that
certain systematic errors arise as a consequence of correlated errors in
group membership determination, central/satellite designation, and halo
mass assignment. We introduce a new statistic, the halo transition
probability (HTP), which captures the combined impact of all these
errors. As a rule of thumb, errors tend to equalize the properties of
distinct galaxy populations (i.e. red versus blue galaxies or centrals
versus satellites), and to result in inferred occupation statistics that
are more accurate for red galaxies than for blue galaxies. A statistic
that is particularly poorly recovered from the group catalogues is the
red fraction of central galaxies as a function of halo mass. Group
finders do a good job in recovering galactic conformity, but also have a
tendency to introduce weak conformity when none is present. We conclude
that proper inference of colour-dependent statistics from group
catalogues is best achieved using forward modelling (i.e. running group
finders over mock data) or by implementing a correction scheme based on
the HTP, as long as the latter is not too strongly model dependent.},

  abstract = {We use the halo occupation model to calibrate galaxy group finders in magnitude limited redshift surveys. Because, according to the current scenario of structure formation, galaxy groups are associated with cold dark matter (CDM) haloes, we make use of the properties of the halo population in the design of our group finder. The method starts with an assumed mass-to-light ratio to assign a tentative mass to each group. This mass is used to estimate the size and velocity dispersion of the underlying halo that hosts the group, which in turn is used to determine group membership (in redshift space). This procedure is repeated until no further changes occur in group memberships. We find that the final groups selected this way are insensitive to the mass-to-light ratio assumed. We use mock catalogues, constructed using the conditional luminosity function (CLF), to test the performance of our group finder in terms of completeness of true members and contamination by
interlopers. Our group finder is more successful than the conventional friends-of-friends (FOF) group finder in assigning galaxies in common dark matter haloes to a single group. We apply our group finder to the 2-degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS) and compare the resulting group properties with model predictions based on the CLF. For the $\Lambda$CDM concordance cosmology, we find a clear discrepancy between
the model and data in the sense that the model predicts too many rich groups. In order to match the observational results, we have to either increase the mass-to-light ratios of rich clusters to a level
significantly higher than current observational estimates, or to assume $\sigma$8\textasciitilde{}= 0.7, compared with the concordance value of 0.9.},

We use a high-resolution N-body simulation to study how the influence of large-scale structure in and around clusters causes correlated signals in different physical probes and discuss some implications this has for multi-physics probes of clusters (e.g. richness, lensing, Compton distortion and velocity dispersion).

We pay particular attention to velocity dispersions, matching galaxies to subhaloes which are explicitly tracked in the simulation. We find that not only do haloes persist as subhaloes when they fall into a larger host, but groups of subhaloes retain their identity for long periods within larger host haloes. The highly anisotropic nature of infall into massive clusters, and their triaxiality, translates into an anisotropic velocity ellipsoid: line-of-sight galaxy velocity
dispersions for any individual halo show large variance depending on viewing angle. The orientation of the velocity ellipsoid is correlated with the large-scale structure, and thus velocity outliers correlate with outliers caused by projection in other probes. We quantify this orientation uncertainty and give illustrative examples. Such a large variance suggests that velocity dispersion estimators will work better in an ensemble sense than for any individual cluster, which may inform strategies for obtaining redshifts of cluster members. We similarly find that the ability of substructure indicators to find kinematic
substructures is highly viewing angle dependent. While groups of subhaloes which merge with a larger host halo can retain their identity for many Gyr, they are only sporadically picked up by substructure indicators.

We discuss the effects of correlated scatter on scaling relations estimated through stacking, both analytically and in the simulations, showing that the strong correlation of measures with mass and the large scatter in mass at fixed observable mitigate line-of-sight projections.},

Many galaxy evolution models assume that satellite galaxies eventually merge with their central galaxy, but this ignores the possibility of satellite tidal disruption. We use a high-resolution N-body simulation of cosmological volume to explore satellite galaxy merging/disruption criteria based on dark matter subhalo dynamics. We explore the impact that satellite
merging/disruption has on the halo occupation distribution and radial profile of the remnants. Using abundance matching to assign stellar mass/luminosity to subhaloes, we compare with observed galaxy
clustering, satellite fractions, cluster satellite luminosity functions, finding that subhaloes reproduce well these observables. Our results imply that satellite subhaloes corresponding to $>$0.2L* galaxies must be well resolved down to 1-3 per cent of their mass at infall to robustly trace the galaxy population.

luminosities with halo/subhalo masses are being developed by several
groups and we present here an updated version of the Vale \& Ostriker
version of this model. This is based on a more accurate, self-consistent
treatment of subhalo mass loss and revised results for the subhalo mass
function (SHMF) to address this question anew. We find that the
mass-luminosity relation, at high mass, particularly for first brightest
galaxies and less so for group total, is almost independent of the
actual luminosity function considered, when luminosity is scaled by the
characteristic luminosity L*. Additionally, the shape of the
total luminosity depends on the slope of the SHMF. For these high mass,
cluster-sized haloes, we find that total luminosity scales as
Ltot \textasciitilde{}M0.88, while the luminosity of the first
brightest galaxy has a much weaker dependence on halo mass,
L1 \textasciitilde{} M0.28, in good agreement with observations
and previous results. At low mass, the resulting slope of the
mass-luminosity relation depends strongly of the faint end slope of the
luminosity function, and we obtain a steep relation, with approximately
L \textasciitilde{} M4.5 for M \textasciitilde{}
1010h-1Msolar in the K band. The
average number of galaxies per halo/cluster is also in very good
agreement with observations, scaling as \textasciitilde{}M0.9.

In general, we obtain a good agreement with several independent sets of
observational data. Taking the model as essentially correct, we consider
two additional possible sources for remaining discrepancies: problems
with the underlying cosmology and with the observational mass
determination. We find that, when comparing with observations and for a
flat cosmology, the model tends to prefer lower values for
$\Omega$m and $\sigma$8. Within the Wilkinson
Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) + Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)
concordance plane of Tegmark et al., we find best agreement around
$\Omega$m = 0.25 and $\sigma$8 = 0.8; this is also
in very good agreement with the results of the cosmic microwave
background (CMB)+2dF study of Sanchez et al. We also check on possible
corrections for observed mass based on a comparison of the equivalent
number of haloes/clusters. Additionally, we include further checks on
the model results based on the mass-to-light ratio, the occupation

measurements and show that the stellar mass density of the universe was
only 50\%, 10\%, and 1\% of its current value at z \textasciitilde{} 0.75, 2.0, and 3.5,
respectively. The quiescent population drives most of the overall
growth, with the stellar mass density of these galaxies increasing as
$\rho$starvprop(1 + z)-4.7 $\pm$ 0.4 since
z = 3.5, whereas the mass density of star-forming galaxies increases as
$\rho$starvprop(1 + z)-2.3 $\pm$ 0.2. At z
$>$ 2.5, star-forming galaxies dominate the total SMF at all stellar
masses, although a non-zero population of quiescent galaxies persists to
z = 4. Comparisons of the Ks -selected star-forming galaxy
SMFs with UV-selected SMFs at 2.5 $<$ z $<$ 4 show reasonable
agreement and suggest that UV-selected samples are representative of the
majority of the stellar mass density at z $>$ 3.5. We estimate the
average mass growth of individual galaxies by selecting galaxies at
fixed cumulative number density. The average galaxy with log(M
star/M $\odot$) = 11.5 at z = 0.3 has grown in
mass by only 0.2 dex (0.3 dex) since z = 2.0 (3.5), whereas those with
log(M star/M $\odot$) = 10.5 have grown by $>$1.0
dex since z = 2. At z $<$ 2, the time derivatives of the mass growth
are always larger for lower-mass galaxies, which demonstrates that the
mass growth in galaxies since that redshift is mass-dependent and
primarily bottom-up. Lastly, we examine potential sources of systematic
uncertainties in the SMFs and find that those from photo-z templates,
stellar population synthesis modeling, and the definition of quiescent
galaxies dominate the total error budget in the SMFs.

increases over the entire mass range. Their comoving stellar mass
density increases by 1.6 dex between z \textasciitilde{} 3 and z \textasciitilde{} 1 and by less than
0.2 dex at z $<$ 1. We infer the star formation history from the mass
density evolution. This inferred star formation history is in excellent
agreement with instantaneous star formation rate measurements at z $<$
1.5, while we find differences of 0.2 dex at z $>$ 1.5 consistent with
the expected uncertainties. We also develop a new method to infer the
specific star formation rate from the mass function of star-forming
galaxies. We find that the specific star formation rate of 1010 -
10.5$\mathscr{M}\odot$ galaxies increases continuously in
the redshift range 1 $<$ z $<$ 4. Finally, we compare our results with
a semi-analytical model and find that these models overestimate the
density of low mass quiescent galaxies by an order of magnitude, while
the density of low-mass star-forming galaxies is successfully
reproduced.

  abstract = {We derive and numerically implement an algorithm for estimating the 3D power spectrum of the Lyman-\$$\backslash$alpha\$ (Ly-\$$\backslash$alpha\$) forest flux fluctuations. The algorithm exploits the unique geometry of Ly-\$$\backslash$alpha\$ forest data to efficiently measure the cross-spectrum between lines of sight as a function of parallel wavenumber, transverse separation and redshift. The key to fast evaluation is to approximate the global covariance matrix as block-diagonal, where only pixels from the same spectrum are correlated. We then compute the eigenvectors of the derivative of the signal covariance with respect to cross-spectrum parameters, and project the inverse-covariance-weighted spectra onto them. This acts much like a radial Fourier transform over redshift windows. The resulting cross-spectrum inference is then converted into our final product, an approximation of the likelihood for the 3D power spectrum expressed as second order Taylor expansion around a fiducial model. We demonstrate the accuracy and scalability of the algorithm and comment on possible extensions. Our algorithm will allow efficient analysis of the upcoming Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument dataset.},

  abstract = {We study 379 central and 159 satellite early-type galaxies with two-dimensional kinematics from the integral-field survey Mapping Nearby Galaxies at APO (MaNGA) to determine how their angular momentum content depends on stellar and halo mass. Using the Yang et al. (2007) group catalog, we identify central and satellite galaxies in groups with halo masses ranging from 10\^12.5 M\_sun/h $<$ M\_200b $<$ 10\^15 Msun/h. As in previous work, we see a sharp dependence on stellar mass, in the sense that \textasciitilde{}70\% of galaxies with stellar mass M* $>$ 10\^11 M\_sun/h\^2 tend to have very little rotation, while nearly all galaxies at lower mass show some net rotation. The \textasciitilde{}30\% of high-mass galaxies that have significant rotation do not stand out in other galaxy properties except for a higher incidence of ionized gas emission. When carefully matching the stellar mass distributions, we find no residual differences in angular momentum content between satellite and central galaxies, and we use mock galaxy catalogs to demonstrate that bias from the group catalogs would not erase these trends when present. Similarly, at fixed mass, galaxies have consistent rotation properties across a wide range of halo mass. Our data support recent simulation results suggesting that major merging and gas accretion have more impact on the rotational support of lower-mass galaxies.},

  title = {The {{Multi}}-Fidelity {{Multi}}-Armed {{Bandit}}},
  abstract = {We study a variant of the classical stochastic \$K\$-armed bandit where observing the outcome of each arm is expensive, but cheap approximations to this outcome are available. For example, in online advertising the performance of an ad can be approximated by displaying it for shorter time periods or to narrower audiences. We formalise this task as a multi-fidelity bandit, where, at each time step, the forecaster may choose to play an arm at any one of \$M\$ fidelities. The highest fidelity (desired outcome) expends cost \$$\backslash$lambda\^\{(m)\}\$. The \$m\^\{$\backslash$text\{th\}\}\$ fidelity (an approximation) expends \$$\backslash$lambda\^\{(m)\} $<$ $\backslash$lambda\^\{(M)\}\$ and returns a biased estimate of the highest fidelity. We develop MF-UCB, a novel upper confidence bound procedure for this setting and prove that it naturally adapts to the sequence of available approximations and costs thus attaining better regret than naive strategies which ignore the approximations. For instance, in the above online advertising example, MF-UCB would use the lower fidelities to quickly eliminate suboptimal ads and reserve the larger expensive experiments on a small set of promising candidates. We complement this result with a lower bound and show that MF-UCB is nearly optimal under certain conditions.},

  shorttitle = {Firefly ({{Fitting IteRativEly For Likelihood analYsis}})},
  abstract = {We present a new spectral fitting code, Firefly, for deriving the stellar population properties of stellar systems. Firefly is a chi-squared minimisation fitting code that fits combinations of single-burst stellar population models to spectroscopic data, following an iterative best-fitting process controlled by the Bayesian Information Criterion. No priors are applied, rather all solutions within a statistical cut are retained with their weight. Moreover, no additive or multiplicative polynomia are employed to adjust the spectral shape. This fitting freedom is envisaged in order to map out the effect of intrinsic spectral energy distribution (SED) degeneracies, such as age, metallicity, dust reddening on galaxy properties, and to quantify the effect of varying input model components on such properties. Dust attenuation is included using a new procedure, which was tested on Integral Field Spectroscopic (IFS) data in a previous paper. The fitting method is extensively tested with a comprehensive suite of mock galaxies, real galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and Milky Way globular clusters. We also assess the robustness of the derived properties as a function of signal-to-noise ratio and adopted wavelength range. We show that $\backslash$FF$\backslash$ is able to recover age, metallicity, stellar mass and even the star formation history remarkably well down to a \$S/N$\backslash$sim5\$, for moderately dusty systems.

  title = {Estimating {{Cosmological Parameters}} from the {{Dark Matter Distribution}}},
  abstract = {A grand challenge of the 21st century cosmology is to accurately estimate the cosmological parameters of our Universe. A major approach to estimating the cosmological parameters is to use the large-scale matter distribution of the Universe. Galaxy surveys provide the means to map out cosmic large-scale structure in three dimensions. Information about galaxy locations is typically summarized in a "single" function of scale, such as the galaxy correlation function or power-spectrum. We show that it is possible to estimate these cosmological parameters directly from the distribution of matter. This paper presents the application of deep 3D convolutional networks to volumetric representation of dark-matter simulations as well as the results obtained using a recently proposed distribution regression framework, showing that machine learning techniques are comparable to, and can sometimes outperform, maximum-likelihood point estimates using "cosmological models". This opens the way to estimating the parameters of our Universe with higher accuracy.},

  abstract = {Numerical simulations play a key important role in modern cosmology. Examples are plenty including the cosmic web - large scale structure of the distribution of galaxies in space - which was first observed in N-body simulations and later discovered in observations. The cuspy dark matter halo profiles, the overabundance of satellites, the Too-Big-Too-Fail problem are other examples of theoretical predictions that have a dramatic impact on recent developments in cosmology and galaxy formation. Large observational surveys such as e.g. SDSS, Euclid, and LSST are intimately connected with extensive cosmological simulations that provide statistical errors and tests for systematics. Accurate predictions for baryonic acoustic oscillations and redshift space distortions from high-resolution and large-volume cosmological simulations are required for interpretation of these large-scale galaxy/qso surveys. However, most of the results from extensive computer simulations, that would be greatly beneficial if publicly available, are still in hands of few research groups. Even when the simulation data is available, sharing vast amounts of data can be overwhelming. We argue that there is an effective and simple path to expand the data access and dissemination of numerous results from different cosmological models. Here we demonstrate that public access can be effectively provided with relatively modest resources. Among different results, we release for the astronomical community terabytes of raw data of th popular Bolshoi and MultiDark simulations. We also provide numerous results that are focused on mimicking observational data and galaxy surveys for major projects. Skies and Universes is a community effort: data are produced and shared by many research groups. We offer to other cosmologists and astronomers to host their data products in the skiesanduniverses.org space.},

Smaller voids are generally in regions with higher neutrino abundance and so their surrounding halos are impacted by a stronger neutrino free streaming. This makes the voids larger (surrounding halos being washed outward the void center). On the contrary, larger voids are generally in regions with lower neutrino abundance and so their surrounding halos are less impacted by neutrino free streaming, making the voids smaller (surrounding halos being squeezed toward the void center). This characteristic change of the spatial distribution of the halos suppresses the 2-point correlation function of halos on scales \$$\backslash$sim\$ 1 Mpc\$/h\$ and significantly skews the number function of the DT voids, which serve as measurable neutrino effects in current or future galaxy surveys.},

  abstract = {The hierarchical galaxy formation scenario in the Cold Dark Matter cosmogony with a non-vanishing cosmological constant and geometrically flat space has been very successful in explaining the large-scale distribution of galaxies. However, there have been claims that the scenario predicts too many satellite galaxies associated with massive galaxies compared to observations, called the missing satellite galaxy problem. Isolated groups of galaxies hosted by passively evolving massive early-type galaxies are ideal laboratories for finding the missing physics in the current theory. Here we report from a deep spectroscopic survey of such satellite systems that isolated massive early-type galaxies with no recent star formation through wet mergers or accretion have almost no satellite galaxies fainter than the r-band absolute magnitude of about Mr =-14. If only early-type satellites are used, the cutoff is at somewhat brighter magnitude of about Mr =-15. Such a cutoff has not been found in other nearby satellite galaxy systems hosted by late-type galaxies or those with merger features. Various physical properties of satellites depend strongly on the host-centric distance. Our observation indicates that the satellite galaxy luminosity function is largely determined by the interaction of satellites with the environment provided by their host, which sheds light on the missing satellite galaxy problem.},

  doi = {10.1093/mnras/stx185},
  abstract = {Fibre-fed multi-object spectroscopic surveys, with their ability to collect an unprecedented number of redshifts, currently dominate large-scale structure studies. However, physical constraints limit these surveys from successfully collecting redshifts from galaxies too close to each other on the focal plane. This ultimately leads to significant systematic effects on galaxy clustering measurements. Using simulated mock catalogues, we demonstrate that fibre collisions have a significant impact on the power spectrum, P(k), monopole and quadrupole that exceeds sample variance at scales smaller than k \texttildelow{} 0.1 h Mpc-1. We present two methods to account for fibre collisions in the power spectrum. The first, statistically reconstructs the clustering of fibre-collided galaxy pairs by modelling the distribution of the line-of-sight displacements between them. It also properly accounts for fibre collisions in the shot-noise correction term of the P(k)
estimator. Using this method, we recover the true P(k) monopole of the mock catalogues with residuals of $<$0.5 per cent at k = 0.3 h
Mpc-1 and $<$4 per cent at k = 0.83 h Mpc-1 - a significant improvement over existing correction methods. The
quadrupole, however, does not improve significantly. The second method models the effect of fibre collisions on the power spectrum as a convolution with a configuration space top-hat function that depends on the physical scale of fibre collisions. It directly computes theoretical predictions of the fibre-collided P(k) multipoles and reduces the influence of smaller scales to a set of nuisance parameters. Using this method, we reliably model the effect of fibre collisions on the monopole and quadrupole down to the scale limits of theoretical predictions. The methods we present in this paper will allow us to robustly analyse galaxy power spectrum multipole measurements to much smaller scales than previously possible.},

  shorttitle = {Scale Dependence of Galaxy Biasing Investigated by Weak Gravitational Lensing},
  abstract = {Galaxies are biased tracers of the matter density on cosmological scales. For future tests of galaxy models, we refine and assess a method to measure galaxy biasing as function of physical scale \$k\$ with weak gravitational lensing. This method enables us to reconstruct the galaxy bias factor \$b(k)\$ as well as the galaxy-matter correlation \$r(k)\$ on physical scales between \$0.01$\backslash$,h$\backslash$,\{$\backslash$rm Mpc\^\{-1\}\}$\backslash$lesssim k$\backslash$lesssim10$\backslash$,h$\backslash$,\{$\backslash$rm Mpc\^\{-1\}\}\$ for redshift-binned lens galaxies below redshift \$z$\backslash$lesssim0.6\$. In the refinement, we account for an intrinsic alignment of source ellipticities, and we correct for the lensing magnification of the angular number density of the lens galaxies to improve the accuracy of the reconstructed \$r(k)\$. For simulated data, the reconstructions achieve an accuracy of \$3-7$\backslash$\%\$ (68$\backslash$\% confidence level) over the above \$k\$-range for a survey area and a typical depth of contemporary ground-based surveys. Realistically the accuracy is, however, probably reduced to about \$10-15$\backslash$\%\$, mainly by systematic errors in the assumed intrinsic source alignments, the fiducial cosmology, and the redshift distributions of lens and source galaxies (in that order). Furthermore, our reconstruction technique employs physical templates for \$b(k)\$ and \$r(k)\$ that elucidate the impact of central galaxies and the halo-occupation statistics of satellite galaxies on the scale-dependence of galaxy bias, which we discuss in the paper. In a first demonstration, we apply this method to previous measurements in the Garching-Bonn-Deep Survey and give a physical interpretation of the lens population.},

Assuming a concordance Lambda-CDM cosmological model, this sample covers an effective volume of 2.2 Gpc\^3, and represents the largest sample of the Universe ever surveyed at this density, n = 3 x 10\^-4 h\^-3 Mpc\^3. We measure the angle-averaged galaxy correlation function and power spectrum, including density-field reconstruction of the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) feature. The acoustic features are detected at a significance of 5$\backslash$sigma in both the correlation function and power spectrum. Combining with the SDSS-II Luminous Red Galaxy Sample, the detection significance increases to 6.7$\backslash$sigma. Fitting for the position of the acoustic features measures the distance to z=0.57 relative to the sound horizon DV /rs = 13.67 +/- 0.22 at z=0.57. Assuming a fiducial sound horizon of 153.19 Mpc, which matches cosmic microwave background constraints, this corresponds to a distance DV(z=0.57) = 2094 +/- 34 Mpc. At 1.7 per cent, this is the most precise distance constraint ever obtained from a galaxy survey. We place this result alongside previous BAO measurements in a cosmological distance ladder and find excellent agreement with the current supernova measurements. We use these distance measurements to constrain various cosmological models, finding continuing support for a flat Universe with a cosmological constant.},

  abstract = {The power spectrum of density fluctuations is a foundational source of cosmological information. Precision cosmological probes targeted primarily at investigations of dark energy require accurate theoretical determinations of the power spectrum in the nonlinear regime. To exploit the observational power of future cosmological surveys, accuracy demands on the theory are at the one percent level or better. Numerical simulations are currently the only way to produce sufficiently error-controlled predictions for the power spectrum. The very high computational cost of (precision) N-body simulations is a major obstacle to obtaining predictions in the nonlinear regime, while scanning over cosmological parameters. Near-future observations, however, are likely to provide a meaningful constraint only on constant dark energy equation of state 'wCDM' cosmologies. In this paper we demonstrate that a limited set of only 37 cosmological models -- the "Coyote Universe" suite -- can be used to predict the nonlinear matter power spectrum at the required accuracy over a prior parameter range set by cosmic microwave background observations. This paper is the second in a series of three, with the final aim to provide a high-accuracy prediction scheme for the nonlinear matter power spectrum for wCDM cosmologies.},

We present a simple prediction scheme, a cosmic emulator, for the c-M relation as a function of cosmological parameters for wCDM models. The emulator is constructed from 37 individual models, with three nested N-body gravity-only simulations carried out for each model. The mass range covered by the emulator is 2 x 10\^\{12\} M\_sun $<$ M $<$10\^\{15\} M\_sun with a corresponding redshift range of z=0 -1. Over this range of mass and redshift, as well as the variation of cosmological parameters studied, the mean halo concentration varies from c \textasciitilde{} 2 to c \textasciitilde{} 8. The distribution of the concentration at fixed mass is Gaussian with a standard deviation of one-third of the mean value, almost independent of cosmology, mass, and redshift over the ranges probed by the simulations. We compare results from the emulator with previously derived heuristic analytic fits for the c-M relation, finding that they underestimate the halo concentration at high masses. Using the emulator to investigate the cosmology dependence of the c-M relation over the currently allowable range of values, we find -- not surprisingly -- that $\backslash$sigma\_8 and $\backslash$omega\_m influence it considerably, but also that the dark energy equation of state parameter, w, has a substantial effect. In general, the concentration of lower-mass halos is more sensitive to changes in cosmological parameters as compared to cluster mass halos.},

for larger halo masses, and the fraction of satellite galaxies decreases
at higher luminosity. We find little evolution in the relation between
mass scales of host halos for central galaxies and satellite galaxies
above the same luminosity threshold. Combining these HOD results with
theoretical predictions of the typical growth of halos, we establish an
evolutionary connection between the galaxy populations at the two
redshifts by linking z\textasciitilde{}0 central galaxies to z\textasciitilde{}1 central galaxies that
reside in their progenitor halos. We find that the stellar mass growth
of galaxies depends on halo mass. On average, the majority of the
stellar mass in central galaxies residing in z\textasciitilde{}0 low-mass halos
(\textasciitilde{}5\texttimes{}1011 h-1 Msolar) and only a
small fraction of the stellar mass in central galaxies of high-mass
halos (\textasciitilde{}1013 h-1 Msolar) result from
star formation between z\textasciitilde{}1 and z\textasciitilde{}0. In addition, the mass scale of halos
where the star formation efficiency reaches a maximum is found to shift
toward lower mass with time. Future work that combines HOD modeling of
the clustering of galaxies at different redshifts with the assembly
history and dynamical evolution of dark matter halos can lead to an
understanding of the stellar mass growth due to both mergers and star
formation as a function of host halo mass and provide powerful tests of
galaxy formation theories.},

This measurement extends the use of the BAO technique from the 2-point correlation function (2PCF) and power spectrum to the 3PCF and opens an avenue for deriving additional cosmological distance information from future large-scale structure redshift surveys such as DESI. Our measured distance scale from the 3PCF is fairly independent from that derived from the pre-reconstruction 2PCF and is equivalent to increasing the length of BOSS by roughly 10$\backslash$\%; reconstruction appears to lower the independence of the distance measurements. Fitting a model including tidal tensor bias yields a moderate significance (\$2.6$\backslash$sigma)\$ detection of this bias with a value in agreement with the prediction from local Lagrangian biasing.},

  abstract = {Analytical models and simulations predict a rapid decline in the halo density profile associated with the transition from the
``infalling'' regime outside the halo to the
``collapsed'' regime within the halo. Using data from SDSS, we
explore evidence for such a feature in the density profiles of galaxy clusters using several different approaches. We first estimate the steepening of the outer galaxy density profile around clusters, finding evidence for truncation of the halo profile. Next, we measure the galaxy density profile around clusters using two sets of galaxies selected on color. We find evidence of an abrupt change in galaxy colors that coincides with the location of the steepening of the density profile. Since galaxies that have completed orbits within the cluster are more likely to be quenched of star formation and thus appear redder, this abrupt change in galaxy color can be associated with the transition from single-stream to multi-stream regimes. We also use a standard model comparison approach to measure evidence for a
``splashback''-like feature, but find that this approach is
very sensitive to modeling assumptions. Finally, we perform measurements using an independent cluster catalog to test for potential systematic errors associated with cluster selection. We identify several avenues for future work: improved understanding of the small-scale galaxy profile, lensing measurements, identification of proxies for the halo accretion rate, and other tests. With upcoming data from the DES, KiDS, and HSC surveys, we can expect significant improvements in the study of halo boundaries.},

measurements to the predictions from three different halo and subhalo models. One is the halo occupation distribution (HOD) model and the other two are extensions of the subhalo abundance matching model by allowing the central and satellite galaxies to have different occupation distributions in the host halos and subhalos. Parameters in all the models are chosen to best describe the projected and redshift-space two-point correlation functions (2PCFs) of the same set of galaxies. All three model predictions agree well with the 3PCF measurements for the most luminous galaxy sample, while the HOD model better performs in matching the 3PCFs of fainter samples (with luminosity threshold below L*), which is similar in trend to the case of fitting the 2PCFs. The decomposition of the model 3PCFs into contributions from different types of galaxy triplets shows that on small scales the dependence of the 3PCFs on triangle shape is driven by nonlinear redshift-space distortion (and not by the intrinsic halo shape) while on large scales it reflects the filamentary structure. The decomposition also reveals more detailed differences in the three models, which are related to the radial distribution, the mean occupation function, and the velocity
distribution of satellite galaxies inside halos. The results suggest that galaxy 3PCFs can further help constrain the above galaxy-halo relation and test theoretical models.},

We describe measurements of the PVD of galaxies in the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey as a function of projected separation and galaxy luminosity.

The measured PVD at projected separations \$r\_$\backslash$bot $<$\textasciitilde{} 1\$ Mpc/h increases near-monotonically with increasing luminosity from \$$\backslash$sigma $\backslash$approx 200\$ km/s at \$M\_r = -17\$ mag to \$$\backslash$sigma $\backslash$approx 600\$ km/s at \$M\_r $\backslash$approx -22\$ mag. Analysis of the Gonzalez-Perez (2014) GALFORM semi-analytic model yields no such trend of PVD with luminosity: the model over-predicts the PVD for faint galaxies.

  shorttitle = {Disruption of {{Dark Matter Substructure}}},
  abstract = {Accurately predicting the demographics of dark matter (DM) substructure is of paramount importance for many fields of astrophysics, including gravitational lensing, galaxy evolution, halo occupation modeling, and constraining the nature of dark matter. Because of its strongly non-linear nature, DM substructure is typically modeled using N-body simulations, which reveal that large fractions of DM subhaloes undergo complete disruption. In this paper we use both analytical estimates and idealized numerical simulations to investigate whether this disruption is mainly physical, due to tidal heating and stripping, or numerical (i.e., artificial). We show that, contrary to naive expectation, subhaloes that experience a tidal shock \$$\backslash$Delta E\$ that exceeds the subhalo's binding energy, \$|E\_\{$\backslash$rm b\}|\$, do not undergo disruption, even when \$$\backslash$Delta E/|E\_\{$\backslash$rm b\}|\$ is as large as 100. Along the same line, and contrary to existing claims in the literature, instantaneously stripping matter from the outskirts of a DM subhalo also does not result in its complete disruption, even when the instantaneous remnant has positive binding energy. In addition, we show that tidal heating due to high-speed (impulsive) encounters with other subhaloes (‘harassment'), is negligible compared to the tidal effects due to the host halo. Hence, we conclude that, in the absence of baryonic processes, the complete, physical disruption of CDM substructure is extremely rare, and that most disruption in numerical simulations therefore must be artificial. We discuss various processes that have been associated with numerical overmerging, and conclude that inadequate force-softening is the most likely culprit.},

  abstract = {The clustering amplitude of 7143 clusters from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) is found to increase linearly with cluster mass, closely agreeing with the Gaussian random field hypothesis for structure formation. In detail, the observed correlation length exceeds pure cold dark matter (CDM) simulation predictions by \$$\backslash$simeq 6$\backslash$\%\$, for the standard Planck-based values of the cosmological parameters. We show this is naturally accounted for by free streaming of light neutrinos, which opposes gravitational growth, so clusters formed at fixed mass are fewer and hence more biased than for a pure CDM density field. An enhancement of cluster bias by \$7$\backslash$\%\$ matches the observations, corresponding to a total neutrino mass, \$$\backslash$sum m\_\{$\backslash$nu\}=(0.11$\backslash$pm0.03)eV\$, for the standard relic neutrino density. If ongoing laboratory experiments favor a normal neutrino mass hierarchy then we may infer a somewhat larger total mass than the minimum oscillation based value, \$$\backslash$sum m\_\{$\backslash$nu\} $\backslash$simeq 0.056eV\$, with \$90$\backslash$\%\$ confidence. Much higher precision can be achieved by applying our method to the more numerous galaxy groups present in the SDSS, for which we predict an appreciable clustering enhancement by neutrinos.},

We create two mock catalogs from Multidark's publicly available \$N\$-body MDPL1 simulation, one with perfect galaxy cluster membership information and the other where a simple cylindrical cut around the cluster center allows interlopers to contaminate the clusters. In the standard approach, we use a power-law scaling relation to infer cluster mass from galaxy line-of-sight (LOS) velocity dispersion. Assuming perfect membership knowledge, this unrealistic case produces a wide fractional mass error distribution, with a width of \$$\backslash$Delta$\backslash$epsilon$\backslash$approx0.87\$. Interlopers introduce additional scatter, significantly widening the error distribution further (\$$\backslash$Delta$\backslash$epsilon$\backslash$approx2.13\$). We employ the support distribution machine (SDM) class of algorithms to learn from distributions of data to predict single values. Applied to distributions of galaxy observables such as LOS velocity and projected distance from the cluster center, SDM yields better than a factor-of-two improvement (\$$\backslash$Delta$\backslash$epsilon$\backslash$approx0.67\$) for the contaminated case. Remarkably, SDM applied to contaminated clusters is better able to recover masses than even the scaling relation approach applied to uncontaminated clusters. We show that the SDM method more accurately reproduces the cluster mass function, making it a valuable tool for employing cluster observations to evaluate cosmological models.},

Different methods are tested against a mock cluster catalog constructed using halos with mass $>$= 10\^14 Msolar/h from Multidark's publicly-available N-body MDPL halo catalog. In the conventional method, we use a standard M(sigma\_v) power law scaling relation to infer cluster mass, M, from line-of-sight (LOS) galaxy velocity dispersion, sigma\_v. The resulting fractional mass error distribution is broad, with width=0.87 (68\% scatter), and has extended high-error tails. The standard scaling relation can be simply enhanced by including higher-order moments of the LOS velocity distribution. Applying the kurtosis as a correction term to log(sigma\_v) reduces the width of the error distribution to 0.74 (16\% improvement). Machine learning can be used to take full advantage of all the information in the velocity distribution. We employ the Support Distribution Machines (SDMs) algorithm that learns from distributions of data to predict single values. SDMs trained and tested on the distribution of LOS velocities yield width=0.46 (47\% improvement). Furthermore, the problematic tails of the mass error distribution are effectively eliminated. Decreasing cluster mass errors will improve measurements of the growth of structure and lead to tighter constraints on cosmological parameters.},

  abstract = {Predicting structural properties of dark matter haloes is one of the 
fundamental goals of modern cosmology. We use the suite of MultiDark
cosmological simulations to study the evolution of dark matter halo
density profiles, concentrations, and velocity anisotropies. We find
that in order to understand the structure of dark matter haloes and to
make 1-2 per cent accurate predictions for density profiles, one needs
to realize that halo concentration is more complex than the ratio of the
virial radius to the core radius in the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW)
profile. For massive haloes, the average density profile is far from the
NFW shape and the concentration is defined by both the core radius and
the shape parameter $\alpha$ in the Einasto approximation. We show that
haloes progress through three stages of evolution. They start as rare
density peaks and experience fast and nearly radial infall that brings
mass closer to the centre, producing a highly concentrated halo. Here,
the halo concentration increases with increasing halo mass and the
concentration is defined by the $\alpha$ parameter with a nearly constant
core radius. Later haloes slide into the plateau regime where the
accretion becomes less radial, but frequent mergers still affect even
the central region. At this stage, the concentration does not depend on
halo mass. Once the rate of accretion and merging slows down, haloes
move into the domain of declining concentration-mass relation because
new accretion piles up mass close to the virial radius while the core
radius is staying constant. Accurate analytical fits are provided.},

  abstract = {In fiber-fed galaxy redshift surveys, the finite size of the fiber plugs prevents two fibers from being placed too close to one another, limiting the ability to study galaxy clustering on all scales. We present a new method for correcting such fiber collision effects in galaxy clustering statistics based on spectroscopic observations. The target galaxy sample is divided into two distinct populations according to the targeting algorithm of fiber placement, one free of fiber collisions and the other consisting of collided galaxies. The clustering statistics are a combination of the contributions from these two populations. Our method makes use of observations in tile overlap regions to measure the contributions from the collided population, and to therefore recover the full clustering statistics. The method is rooted in solid theoretical ground and is tested extensively on mock galaxy catalogs. We demonstrate that our method can well recover the projected and the full
three-dimensional (3D) redshift-space two-point correlation functions (2PCFs) on scales both below and above the fiber collision scale, superior to the commonly used nearest neighbor and angular correction methods. We discuss potential systematic effects in our method. The statistical correction accuracy of our method is only limited by sample variance, which scales down with (the square root of) the volume probed. For a sample similar to the final SDSS-III BOSS galaxy sample, the statistical correction error is expected to be at the level of 1\% on scales \textasciitilde{}0.1-30 h -1 Mpc for the 2PCFs. The systematic error only occurs on small scales, caused by imperfect correction of collision multiplets, and its magnitude is expected to be smaller than 5\%. Our correction method, which can be generalized to other clustering
statistics as well, enables more accurate measurements of full 3D galaxy clustering on all scales with galaxy redshift surveys.},

accuracy is challenging and demands an understanding of many potential

that they do not combine significantly when compared to statistical
error of the BAO measurement. Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey
(BOSS) Data Release 11 (DR11) reaches a distance measurement with
\texttildelow{}1 per cent statistical error and this prompts an extensive search
for all possible sub-per cent level systematic errors which could
previously be safely ignored. In this paper, we analyse the potential
systematics in BAO fitting methodology using mocks and data from BOSS
DR10 and DR11. We demonstrate the robustness of the fiducial multipole
fitting methodology to be at 0.1-0.2 per cent level with a wide range of
tests in mock galaxy catalogues pre- and post-reconstruction. We also
find the DR10 and DR11 data from BOSS to be robust against changes in
methodology at a similar level. This systematic error budget is
incorporated into the BOSS DR10 and DR11 BAO measurements. Of the wide
range of changes we have investigated, we find that when fitting
post-reconstructed data or mocks, the only change which has an effect
$>$0.1 per cent on the best-fitting values of distance measurements is
varying the order of the polynomials to describe the broad-band terms
(\texttildelow{}0.2 per cent). Finally, we compare an alternative methodology
denoted as Clustering Wedges with Multipoles, and find that it is

The limiting factor in this analysis is the theoretical modeling of the galaxy power spectrum, including nonlinearities, galaxy bias, and redshift-space distortions. In this paper we assess several different methods for modeling the theoretical power spectrum, testing them against the Gigaparsec WiggleZ simulations (GiggleZ). We fit for a base set of six cosmological parameters,

measure the angular diameter distance DM and Hubble parameter
H from the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) method, in combination with
a cosmic microwave background prior on the sound horizon scale, after
applying reconstruction to reduce non-linear effects on the BAO feature.
Using the anisotropic clustering of the pre-reconstruction density
field, we measure the product DMH from the Alcock-Paczynski
(AP) effect and the growth of structure, quantified by
f$\sigma$8(z), from redshift-space distortions (RSD). We
combine individual measurements presented in seven companion papers into
a set of consensus values and likelihoods, obtaining constraints that
are tighter and more robust than those from any one method; in
particular, the AP measurement from sub-BAO scales sharpens constraints
from post-reconstruction BAOs by breaking degeneracy between
DM and H. Combined with Planck 2016 cosmic microwave
background measurements, our distance scale measurements simultaneously
imply curvature $\Omega$K = 0.0003 $\pm$ 0.0026 and a dark
energy equation-of-state parameter w = -1.01 $\pm$ 0.06, in strong
affirmation of the spatially flat cold dark matter (CDM) model with a

H0 = 67.3 $\pm$ 1.0 km s-1 Mpc-1

  abstract = {We extract cosmological information from the anisotropic power-spectrum 
measurements from the recently completed Baryon Oscillation
Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS), extending the concept of clustering wedges
to Fourier space. Making use of new fast-Fourier-transform-based
estimators, we measure the power-spectrum clustering wedges of the BOSS
sample by filtering out the information of Legendre multipoles $\mathscr{l}$
$>$ 4. Our modelling of these measurements is based on novel approaches
to describe non-linear evolution, bias and redshift-space distortions,
which we test using synthetic catalogues based on large-volume N-body
simulations. We are able to include smaller scales than in previous
analyses, resulting in tighter cosmological constraints. Using three
overlapping redshift bins, we measure the angular-diameter distance, the
Hubble parameter and the cosmic growth rate, and explore the
cosmological implications of our full-shape clustering measurements in
combination with cosmic microwave background and Type Ia supernova data.
Assuming a $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmology, we
constrain the matter density to $\Omega$ M=
0.311\_\{-0.010\}\^\{+0.009\} and the Hubble parameter to H\_0 =
67.6\_\{-0.6\}\^\{+0.7\} km s\^\{-1 Mpc\^\{-1\}\}, at a confidence level of 68 per
cent. We also allow for non-standard dark energy models and
modifications of the growth rate, finding good agreement with the
$\Lambda$CDM paradigm. For example, we constrain the equation-of-state
parameter to w = -1.019\_\{-0.039\}\^\{+0.048\}. This paper is part of a set
that analyses the final galaxy-clustering data set from BOSS. The
measurements and likelihoods presented here are combined with others in

surveys. Using an ensemble of very large dark matter $\Lambda$CDM N-body
simulations, we compare internal error estimators (jackknife and
bootstrap) to external ones (Monte Carlo realizations). For
three-dimensional clustering statistics, we find that none of the
internal error methods investigated is able to reproduce either
accurately or robustly the errors of external estimators on 1 to
25h-1Mpc scales. The standard bootstrap overestimates the
variance of $\xi$(s) by \textasciitilde{}40 per cent on all scales probed, but recovers,
in a robust fashion, the principal eigenvectors of the underlying
covariance matrix. The jackknife returns the correct variance on large
scales, but significantly overestimates it on smaller scales. This scale
dependence in the jackknife affects the recovered eigenvectors, which
tend to disagree on small scales with the external estimates. Our
results have important implications for fitting models to galaxy
clustering measurements. For example, in a two-parameter fit to the
projected correlation function, we find that the standard bootstrap
systematically overestimates the 95 per cent confidence interval, while
the jackknife method remains biased, but to a lesser extent. Ignoring
the systematic bias, the scatter between realizations, for Gaussian
statistics, implies that a 2$\sigma$ confidence interval, as inferred
from an internal estimator, corresponds in practice to anything from
1$\sigma$ to 3$\sigma$. By oversampling the subvolumes, we find that it is
possible, at least for the cases we consider, to obtain robust bootstrap
variances and confidence intervals that agree with external error
estimates. Our results are applicable to two-point statistics, like
$\xi$(s) and wp(rp), measured in large redshift
surveys, and show that the interpretation of clustering measurements
with internally estimated errors should be treated with caution.},

We perform an eigenmode decomposition of the connected part of the
covariance matrix, showing that at higher k, it is dominated by a single eigenmode. The full covariance matrix can be approximated as the disconnected part only, with the connected part being treated as an external nuisance parameter with a known scale dependence, and a known prior on its variance for a given survey volume. Finally, we provide a prescription for how to evaluate the covariance matrix from small box simulations without the need to simulate large volumes.},

on perturbation theory and non-linear stochastic biasing with the novel
PATCHY code. In particular, we use Augmented Lagrangian Perturbation
Theory (ALPT) to generate a dark matter density field on a mesh starting
from Gaussian fluctuations and to compute the peculiar velocity field.
ALPT is based on a combination of second order LPT (2LPT) on large
scales and the spherical collapse model on smaller scales. We account
for the systematic deviation of perturbative approaches from N-body
simulations together with halo biasing adopting an exponential bias
model. We then account for stochastic biasing by defining three regimes:
a low-, an intermediate- and a high-density regime, using a Poisson
distribution in the intermediate regime and the negative binomial
distribution - including an additional parameter - to model
over-dispersion in the high-density regime. Since we focus in this study
on massive haloes, we suppress the generation of haloes in the
low-density regime. The various non-linear and stochastic biasing
parameters, and density thresholds, are calibrated with the large
BigMultiDark N-body simulation to match the power spectrum of the
corresponding halo population. Our model effectively includes only five
parameters, as they are additionally constrained by the halo number
density. Our mock catalogues show power spectra, in both real- and
redshift-space, which are compatible with N-body simulations within
about 2 per cent up to k \texttildelow{} 1 h Mpc-1 at z = 0.577 for a
sample of haloes with the typical Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic
Survey (BOSS) CMASS (constant stellar mass galaxy sample) galaxy number
density. The corresponding correlation functions are compatible down to
a few Mpc. We also find that neglecting over-dispersion in high-density
regions produces power spectra with deviations of 10 per cent at k
\texttildelow{} 0.4 h Mpc-1. These results indicate the need to
account for an accurate statistical description of the galaxy clustering

we constrain the bias parameters of the PATCHY-code. In addition to
aiming at reproducing the two-point statistics, we seek the set of bias
parameters, which constrain the univariate halo probability distribution
function (PDF) encoding higher order correlation functions. We
demonstrate that halo catalogues based on the same underlying dark
matter field with a fix halo number density, and accurately matching the
power spectrum (within 2 per cent) can lead to very different bispectra
depending on the adopted halo bias model. A model ignoring the shape of
the halo PDF can lead to deviations up to factors of 2. The catalogues
obtained additionally constraining the shape of the halo PDF can
significantly lower the discrepancy in the three-point statistics,
yielding closely unbiased bispectra both in real and in redshift space;
which are in general compatible with those corresponding to an N-body
simulation within 10 per cent (deviating at most up to 20 per cent). Our
calculations show that the constant linear bias of \texttildelow{}2 for luminous
red galaxy (LRG) like galaxies found in the power spectrum, mainly comes
from sampling haloes in high-density peaks, choosing a high-density
threshold rather than from a factor multiplying the dark matter density
field. Our method contributes towards an efficient modelling of the
halo/galaxy distribution required to estimate uncertainties in the
clustering measurements from galaxy redshift surveys. We have also
demonstrated that it represents a powerful tool to test various bias
models.},

  abstract = {We present a new fast and efficient approach to model structure formation with augmented Lagrangian perturbation theory (ALPT). Our method is based on splitting the displacement field into a long- and a short-range component. The long-range component is computed by
second-order LPT (2LPT). This approximation contains a tidal non-local and non-linear term. Unfortunately, 2LPT fails on small scales due to severe shell crossing and a crude quadratic behaviour in the low-density regime. The spherical collapse (SC) approximation has been recently reported to correct for both effects by adding an ideal collapse truncation. However, this approach fails to reproduce the structures on large scales where it is significantly less correlated with the N-body result than 2LPT or linear LPT (the Zel'dovich approximation). We propose to combine both approximations using for the short-range displacement field the SC solution. A Gaussian filter with a smoothing radius rS is used to separate between both regimes. We use the result of 25 dark-matter-only N-body simulations to benchmark at z = 0 the different approximations: first-, second-, third-order LPT, SC and our novel combined ALPT model. This comparison demonstrates that our method improves previous approximations at all scales showing \texttildelow{}25 and \texttildelow{}75 per cent higher correlation than 2LPT with the N-body
solution at k = 1 and 2 h Mpc-1, respectively. We conduct a parameter study to determine the optimal range of smoothing radii and find that the maximum correlation is achieved with rS = 4-5 h-1 Mpc. This structure formation approach could be used for various purposes, such as setting-up initial conditions for N-body simulations, generating mock galaxy catalogues, cosmic web analysis or for reconstructions of the primordial density fluctuations.},

We find that halo mass depends not only on local dark matter density, but also on non-local quantities such as the cosmic web environment and the halo-exclusion effect. Given these accurate relations, we have developed the HADRON-code (Halo mAss Distribution ReconstructiON), a technique which permits us to assign halo masses to a distribution of haloes in three-dimensional space. This can be applied to the fast production of mock galaxy catalogues, by assigning halo masses, and reproducing accurately the bias for different mass cuts. The resulting clustering of the halo populations agree well with that drawn from the BigMultiDark N-body simulation: the power spectra are within 1$\sigma$ up to scales of k = 0.2 h Mpc-1, when using augmented Lagrangian perturbation theory based mock
catalogues. Only the most massive haloes show a larger deviation. For these, we find evidence of the halo-exclusion effect. A clear
improvement is achieved when assigning the highest masses to haloes with a minimum distance separation. We also compute the two- and three-point correlation functions, and find an excellent agreement with N-body results. Our work represents a quantitative application of the cosmic web classification.

Well-known linear transformation methods include principal component analysis, factor analysis, and projection pursuit. Independent component analysis (ICA) is a recently developed method in which the goal is to find a linear representation of non-Gaussian data so that the components are statistically independent, or as independent as possible.

We are now fitting physical models to measured clustering statistics. Galaxy clustering is thus in a position to directly constrain cosmological and galaxy formation theories. This paradigm shift from qualitative to quantitative demands that we
understand the statistical and systematic errors in our measurements. Moreover, we must quantify the theoretical uncertainties in our models, which are no longer clearly sub-dominant to observational errors.

We address this emerging need with the LasDamas project (LArge Suite of DArk MAtter Simulations) by producing an unprecedented number of independent and realistic mock galaxy catalogs. To date, we have run over 100 independent N-body realizations using a fixed cosmology and initialized using 2nd order Lagrangian perturbation theory. We populate overdensities of dark matter using the halo occupation distribution framework, designed to match both small and large scale clustering of the observed SDSS data. A series of mock galaxy catalogs matching the geometry of the final SDSS release (DR7) are created over a wide luminosity range to correspond to Main and LRG volume-limited samples.

$\Omega$mh2, baryon density,
$\Omega$bh2, Hubble constant, H0,

and a slope for the scalar perturbation spectrum, ns) fits
not only the 3 year WMAP temperature and polarization data, but also
small-scale CMB data, light element abundances, large-scale structure
observations, and the supernova luminosity/distance relationship. Using
WMAP data only, the best-fit values for cosmological parameters for the
power-law flat $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model are
($\Omega$mh2,$\Omega$bh2,h,ns,$\tau$,$\sigma$8)=(0.1277+0.0080-0.0079,0.02229+/-0.00073,0.732+0.031-0.032,0.958+/-0.016,0.089+/-0.030,0.761+0.049-0.048).
The 3 year data dramatically shrink the allowed volume in this
six-dimensional parameter space. Assuming that the primordial
fluctuations are adiabatic with a power-law spectrum, the WMAP data
alone require dark matter and favor a spectral index that is
significantly less than the Harrison-Zel'dovich-Peebles scale-invariant
spectrum (ns=1, r=0). Adding additional data sets improves
the constraints on these components and the spectral slope. For
power-law models, WMAP data alone puts an improved upper limit on the
tensor-to-scalar ratio, r0.002$<$0.65 (95\% CL) and the
combination of WMAP and the lensing-normalized SDSS galaxy survey
implies r0.002$<$0.30 (95\% CL). Models that suppress
large-scale power through a running spectral index or a large-scale
cutoff in the power spectrum are a better fit to the WMAP and
small-scale CMB data than the power-law $\Lambda$CDM model; however, the
improvement in the fit to the WMAP data is only
$\Delta\chi$2=3 for 1 extra degree of freedom. Models with a
running-spectral index are consistent with a higher amplitude of gravity
waves. In a flat universe, the combination of WMAP and the Supernova
Legacy Survey (SNLS) data yields a significant constraint on the
equation of state of the dark energy,
w=-0.967+0.073-0.072. If we assume w=-1, then the
deviations from the critical density, $\Omega$K, are small:
the combination of WMAP and the SNLS data implies
$\Omega$k=-0.011+/-0.012. The combination of WMAP 3 year data
plus the HST Key Project constraint on H0 implies
$\Omega$k=-0.014+/-0.017 and
$\Omega\Lambda$=0.716+/-0.055. Even if we do not include the
prior that the universe is flat, by combining WMAP, large-scale
structure, and supernova data, we can still put a strong constraint on
the dark energy equation of state, w=-1.08+/-0.12. For a flat universe,
the combination of WMAP and other astronomical data yield a constraint
on the sum of the neutrino masses, $\Sigma$m$\nu{}<$0.66 eV

  abstract = {The standard procedure to generate initial conditions in numerical simulations of structure formations is to use the Zel'dovich
approximation (ZA). Although the ZA correctly reproduces the linear growing modes of density and velocity perturbations, non-linear growth is inaccurately represented, particularly for velocity perturbations because of the ZA failure to conserve momentum. This implies that it takes time for the actual dynamics to establish the correct statistical properties of density and velocity fields. We extend the standard formulation of non-linear perturbation theory (PT) to include transients as non-linear excitations of decaying modes caused by the initial conditions. These new non-linear solutions interpolate between the initial conditions and the late-time solutions given by the exact non-linear dynamics. To quantify the magnitude of transients, we focus on higher order statistics of the density contrast delta and velocity divergence Theta, characterized by the S\_p and T\_p parameters. These describe the non-Gaussianity of the probability distribution through its connected moments
\_c=S\_p\^p-1,\_c=T\_p\^p-1.
We calculate S\_p(a) and T\_p(a) to leading order in PT with top-hat smoothing as a function of the scale factor a. We find that the
time-scale of transients is determined, at a given order p, by the effective spectral index n\_eff. The skewness factor S\_3(T\_3) attains 10 per cent accuracy only after a\textasciitilde{}6(a\textasciitilde{}15) for n\_eff\textasciitilde{}0, whereas higher (lower) n\_eff demands more (less) expansion away from the initial conditions. These requirements become much more stringent as p
increases, always showing slower decay of transients for T\_p than S\_p. For models with density parameter Omega$\not =$1, the conditions above apply to the linear growth factor; thus an Omega=0.3 open model requires roughly a factor of 2 larger expansion than a critical density model to reduce transients by the same amount. The predicted transients in S\_p are in good agreement with numerical simulations. More accurate initial conditions can be achieved by using second-order Lagrangian PT (2LPT), which reproduces growing modes up to second order and thus eliminates transients in the skewness parameters. We show that for p$>$3 this scheme can reduce the required expansion by more than an order of magnitude compared to the ZA. Setting up 2LPT initial conditions requires only minimal, inexpensive changes to ZA codes. We suggest simple steps for its implementation.},

  abstract = {We study the impact of setting initial conditions in numerical simulations using the standard procedure based on the Zel'dovich approximation (ZA). As it is well known from the perturbation theory, ZA initial conditions have incorrect second- and higher-order growth and therefore excite long-lived transients in the evolution of the
statistical properties of density and velocity fields. We also study the improvement brought by using more accurate initial conditions based on second-order Lagrangian perturbation theory (2LPT). We show that 2LPT initial conditions reduce transients significantly and thus are much more appropriate for numerical simulations devoted to precision
cosmology. Using controlled numerical experiments with ZA and 2LPT initial conditions, we show that simulations started at redshift zi = 49 using the ZA underestimate the power spectrum in the non-linear regime by about 2,4 and8per cent at z = 0,1, and3,
respectively, whereas the mass function of dark matter haloes is underestimated by 5 per cent at m =
1015Msolarh-1 (z = 0) and 10 per cent at m = 2 \texttimes{} 1014Msolarh-1 (z = 1). The clustering of haloes is also affected to the few per cent level at z = 0. These systematics effects are typically larger than statistical uncertainties in recent mass function and power spectrum fitting formulae extracted from numerical simulations. At large scales, the measured transients in higher-order correlations can be understood from first principle calculations based on perturbation theory.},

  abstract = {We discuss the cosmological simulation code GADGET-2, a new massively parallel TreeSPH code, capable of following a collisionless fluid with the N-body method, and an ideal gas by means of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). Our implementation of SPH manifestly conserves energy and entropy in regions free of dissipation, while allowing for fully adaptive smoothing lengths. Gravitational forces are computed with a hierarchical multipole expansion, which can optionally be applied in the form of a TreePM algorithm, where only short-range forces are computed with the ‘tree' method while long-range forces are determined with Fourier techniques. Time integration is based on a quasi-symplectic scheme where long-range and short-range forces can be integrated with different time-steps. Individual and adaptive short-range time-steps may also be employed. The domain decomposition used in the parallelization algorithm is based on a space-filling curve, resulting in high
flexibility and tree force errors that do not depend on the way the domains are cut. The code is efficient in terms of memory consumption and required communication bandwidth. It has been used to compute the first cosmological N-body simulation with more than 1010 dark matter particles, reaching a homogeneous spatial dynamic range of 105 per dimension in a three-dimensional box. It has also been used to carry out very large cosmological SPH simulations that account for radiative cooling and star formation, reaching total particle numbers of more than 250 million. We present the algorithms used by the code and discuss their accuracy and performance using a number of test problems. GADGET-2 is publicly released to the research community.},

Extracting scientific knowledge from these data will increasingly demand both efficient algorithms as well as the power of parallel computers.  Such machines will range in size from small Beowulf clusters to large, massively parallel platforms (MPPs) to collections of MPPs distributed across a Grid, such as the NSF TeraGrid facility. Nearly all efficient analyses of large astronomical datasets use trees as their fundamental data structure.  Writing efficient tree-based techniques, a task that is time-consuming even on
single-processor computers, is exceedingly cumbersome on parallel or grid-distributed resources.  We have developed a framework, Ntropy, that provides a flexible, extensible, and easy-to-use way of developing tree-based data analysis algorithms for both serial and parallel platforms.  Our experience has shown that not only does our framework save development time, it also delivers an increase in serial
performance. Furthermore, our framework makes it easy for an astronomer with little or no parallel programming experience to scale their application quickly to a distributed, multi-processor environment.  By minimizing development time for efficient and scalable data analysis, we will enable wide-scale knowledge discovery on massive datasets.},

  abstract = {Mixture models combine multiple components into a single probability density function. They are a natural statistical model for many situations in astronomy, such as surveys containing multiple types of objects, cluster analysis in various data spaces, and complicated distribution functions. This chapter in the CRC Handbook of Mixture Analysis is concerned with astronomical applications of mixture models for cluster analysis, classification, and semi-parametric density estimation. We present several classification examples from the literature, including identification of a new class, analysis of contaminants, and overlapping populations. In most cases, mixtures of normal (Gaussian) distributions are used, but it is sometimes necessary to use different distribution functions derived from astrophysical experience. We also address the use of mixture models for the analysis of spatial distributions of objects, like galaxies in redshift surveys or young stars in star-forming regions. In the case of galaxy clustering, mixture models may not be the optimal choice for understanding the homogeneous and isotropic structure of voids and filaments. However, we show that mixture models, using astrophysical models for star clusters, may provide a natural solution to the problem of subdividing a young stellar population into subclusters. Finally, we explore how mixture models can be used for mathematically advanced modeling of data with heteroscedastic uncertainties or missing values, providing two example algorithms, the measurement error regression model of Kelly (2007) and the Extreme Deconvolution model of Bovy et al. (2011). The challenges presented by astronomical science, aided by the public availability of catalogs from major surveys and missions, are a rich area for collaboration between statisticians and astronomers.},

  abstract = {The non-zero mass of neutrinos suppresses the growth of cosmic structure on small scales. Since the level of suppression depends on the sum of the masses of the three active neutrino species, the evolution of large-scale structure is a promising tool to constrain the total mass of neutrinos and possibly shed light on the mass hierarchy. In this work, we investigate these effects via a large suite of N-body simulations that include massive neutrinos using an analytic linear-response approximation: the Cosmological Massive Neutrino Simulations (MassiveNuS). The simulations include the effects of radiation on the background expansion, as well as the clustering of neutrinos in response to the nonlinear dark matter evolution. We allow three cosmological parameters to vary: the neutrino mass sum M\_nu in the range of 0-0.6 eV, the total matter density Omega\_m, and the primordial power spectrum amplitude A\_s. The rms density fluctuation in spheres of 8 comoving Mpc/h (sigma\_8) is a derived parameter as a result. Our data products include N-body snapshots, halo catalogues, merger trees, ray- traced galaxy lensing convergence maps for four source redshift planes between z\_s=1-2.5, and ray-traced cosmic microwave background lensing convergence maps. We describe the simulation procedures and code validation in this paper. The data are publicly available at http://columbialensing.org.},

The variation of the LOS across a galaxy survey complicates the measurement of the observed clustering as a function of the angle to the LOS, as fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) based on Cartesian grids, cannot individually allow for this. Recent advances in methodology for calculating LOS-dependent clustering in Fourier space include the realization that power spectrum LOS-dependent moments can be constructed from sums over galaxies, based on
approximating the LOS to each pair of galaxies by the LOS to one of them. We show that we can implement this method using multiple FFTs, each measuring the LOS-weighted clustering along different axes. The Nlog N nature of FFTs means that the computational speed-up is a factor of $>$1000 compared with summing over galaxies. This development should be beneficial for future projects such as DESI and Euclid which will provide an order of magnitude more galaxies than current surveys.},

  abstract = {Measurements of line-of-sight dependent clustering via the galaxy power spectrum's multipole moments constitute a powerful tool for testing theoretical models in large-scale structure. Recent work shows that this measurement, including a moving line-of-sight, can be accelerated using Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs) by decomposing the Legendre polynomials into products of Cartesian vectors. Here, we present a faster, optimal means of using FFTs for this measurement. We avoid redundancy present in the Cartesian decomposition by using a spherical harmonic decomposition of the Legendre polynomials. With this method, a given multipole of order l requires only 2l+1 FFTs rather than the (l+1)(l+2)/2 FFTs of the Cartesian approach. For the hexadecapole (l = 4), this translates to 40\% fewer FFTs, with increased savings for higher l. The reduction in wall-clock time enables the calculation of finely-binned wedges in P(k,$\mu$), obtained by computing multipoles up to a large
lmax and combining them. This transformation has a number of advantages. We demonstrate that by using non-uniform bins in $\mu$, we can isolate plane-of-sky (angular) systematics to a narrow bin at 0$\mu$ simeq while eliminating the contamination from all other bins. We also show that the covariance matrix of clustering wedges binned uniformly in $\mu$ becomes ill-conditioned when combining multipoles up to large
values of lmax, but that the problem can be avoided with non-uniform binning. As an example, we present results using
lmax=16, for which our procedure requires a factor of 3.4 fewer FFTs than the Cartesian method, while removing the first $\mu$ bin leads only to a 7\% increase in statistical error on f
$\sigma$8, as compared to a 54\% increase with
lmax=4.},

recover the true halo multiplicity function, projected size

group multiplicity function that is unbiased with respect to the true
halo multiplicity function; an unbiased median relation between the
multiplicities of groups and their associated halos; a spurious group

Taking into account redshift-space distortions, nonlinear evolution, the survey selection function, and discreteness and finite-volume effects, all three catalogs show evidence for the dependence of the bispectrum on the configuration shape predicted by gravitational instability. Assuming Gaussian initial conditions and local biasing parameterized by linear and nonlinear bias parameters b1 and b2, a likelihood analysis yields 1/b1=1.32+0.36-0.58,

$\chi$2 non-Gaussian initial conditions, the bispectrum
displays an amplitude and scale dependence different from that found in the Gaussian case; if IRAS galaxies do not have bias b1$>$1 at large scales, $\chi$2 non-Gaussian initial conditions are ruled out at the 95\% confidence level.

It has been shown by Panter and Dite that, in the limit as the number of quanta becomes infinite, the asymptotic fractional density of quanta per unit voltage should vary as the one-third power of the probability density per unit voltage of signal amplitudes. In this paper the corresponding result for any finite number of quanta is derived; that is, necessary conditions are found that the quanta and associated quantization intervals of an optimum finite quantization scheme must satisfy. The optimization criterion used is that the average quantization noise power be a minimum. It is shown that the result obtained here goes over into the Panter and Dite result as the number of quanta become large. The optimum quautization schemes for2\^bquanta,b=1,2, cdots, 7, are given numerically for Gaussian and for Laplacian distribution of signal amplitudes.},

novel capacity to probe the emission region of a handful of supermassive
black holes on sub-horizon scales. For Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), the
supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way, this provides
access to the region in the immediate vicinity of the horizon. Broderick
et al. have already shown that by leveraging spectral and polarization
information as well as accretion theory, it is possible to extract
accretion-model parameters (including black hole spin) from mm-VLBI
experiments containing only a handful of telescopes. Here we repeat this
analysis with the most recent mm-VLBI data, considering a class of
aligned, radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) models. We find
that the combined data set rules out symmetric models for Sgr A*'s flux
distribution at the 3.9$\sigma$ level, strongly favoring length-to-width
ratios of roughly 2.4:1. More importantly, we find that physically
motivated accretion flow models provide a significantly better fit to
the mm-VLBI observations than phenomenological models, at the 2.9$\sigma$
level. This implies that not only is mm-VLBI presently capable of
distinguishing between potential physical models for Sgr A*'s emission,
but further that it is sensitive to the strong gravitational lensing
associated with the propagation of photons near the black hole. Based
upon this analysis we find that the most probable magnitude, viewing

SDSS-IV (Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV) survey that will obtain resolved
spectroscopy from 3600 to 10 300 \AA{} for a representative sample of
over 10 000 nearby galaxies. In this paper, we derive spatially resolved
stellar population properties and radial gradients by performing full
spectral fitting of observed galaxy spectra from P-MaNGA, a prototype of
the MaNGA instrument. These data include spectra for 18 galaxies,
covering a large range of morphological type. We derive age,
metallicity, dust, and stellar mass maps, and their radial gradients,
using high spectral-resolution stellar population models, and assess the
impact of varying the stellar library input to the models. We introduce
a method to determine dust extinction which is able to give smooth
stellar mass maps even in cases of high and spatially non-uniform dust
attenuation. With the spectral fitting, we produce detailed maps of
stellar population properties which allow us to identify galactic
features among this diverse sample such as spiral structure, smooth
radial profiles with little azimuthal structure in spheroidal galaxies,
and spatially distinct galaxy sub-components. In agreement with the
literature, we find the gradients for galaxies identified as early type
to be on average flat in age, and negative (-0.15 dex/Re) in
metallicity, whereas the gradients for late-type galaxies are on average
negative in age (-0.39 dex/Re) and flat in metallicity. We
demonstrate how different levels of data quality change the precision
with which radial gradients can be measured. We show how this analysis,
extended to the large numbers of MaNGA galaxies, will have the potential
to shed light on galaxy structure and evolution.},

how ‘red' and ‘blue' galaxies have been selected/defined. Accordingly,
we model our data as two naturally overlapping populations, each with
their own mass function and colour-mass relation, which enables us
characterize the two populations without having to specify a priori
which galaxies are ‘red' and ‘blue'. Our results then provide the means
to derive objective operational definitions for the terms ‘red' and
‘blue', which are based on the phenomenology of the colour-mass
diagrams. Informed by this descriptive modelling, we show that (1) after
accounting for dust, the stellar colours of ‘blue' galaxies do not
depend strongly on mass; (2) the tight, flat ‘dead sequence' does not
extend much below log M* \texttildelow{} 10.5; instead, (3) the
stellar colours of ‘red' galaxies vary rather strongly with mass, such
that lower mass ‘red' galaxies have bluer stellar populations; (4) below
log M* \texttildelow{} 9.3, the ‘red' population dissolves into
obscurity, and it becomes problematic to talk about two distinct
populations; as a consequence, (5) it is hard to meaningfully constrain
the shape, including the existence of an upturn, of the ‘red' galaxy

from data, can be used to classify data, which is one of the most common
tasks in observational astronomy. In this paper, we focus on Bayesian
data classification algorithms using the Gaussian mixture model and show
two applications in pulsar astronomy. After reviewing the Gaussian
mixture model and the related expectation-maximization algorithm, we
present a data classification method using the Neyman-Pearson test. To
demonstrate the method, we apply the algorithm to two classification
problems. First, it is applied to the well-known period-period
derivative diagram, where we find that the pulsar distribution can be
modelled with six Gaussian clusters, with two clusters for millisecond
pulsars (recycled pulsars) and the rest for normal pulsars. From this
distribution, we derive an empirical definition for millisecond pulsars
as \{P$\backslash$dot;\}/\{10-17\}$\leq$3.23(\{P\}/\{100ms\})-2.34.
The two millisecond pulsar clusters may have different evolutionary origins,
since the companion stars to these pulsars in the two clusters show
different chemical compositions. Four clusters are found for normal
pulsars. Possible implications for these clusters are also discussed.
Our second example is to calculate the likelihood of unidentified Fermi
point sources being pulsars and rank them accordingly. In the ranked
point-source list, the top 5 per cent sources contain 50 per cent known
pulsars, the top 50 per cent contain 99 per cent known pulsars and no
known active galaxy (the other major population) appears in the top 6
per cent. Such a ranked list can be used to help the future follow-up
observations for finding pulsars in unidentified Fermi point sources.},

Data are represented by a mixture model in which each component corresponds to a different cluster. Models with varying geometric properties are obtained through Gaussian components with different parametrizations and cross-cluster constraints. Noise and outliers can be modelled by adding a Poisson process component. Partitions are determined by the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for maximum likelihood, with initial values from agglomerative hierarchical clustering. Models are compared using an approximation to the Bayes factor based on the Bayesian information criterion (BIC); unlike significance tests, this allows comparison of more than two models at the same time, and removes the restriction that the models compared be nested. The problems of determining the number of clusters and the clustering method are solved simultaneously by choosing the best model. Moreover, the EM result provides a measure of uncertainty about the associated classification of each data point. Examples are given, showing that this approach can give performance that is much better than standard procedures, which often fail to identify groups that are either overlapping or of varying sizes and shapes.},

  abstract = {The extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) is one of the first of a new generation of galaxy redshift surveys that will cover a large range in redshift with sufficient resolution to measure the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) signal. For surveys covering a large redshift range we can no longer ignore cosmological evolution, meaning that either the redshift shells analysed have to be significantly narrower than the survey, or we have to allow for the averaging over evolving quantities. Both of these have the potential to remove signal: analysing small volumes increases the size of the Fourier window function, reducing the large-scale information, while averaging over evolving quantities can, if not performed carefully, remove differential information. It will be important to measure cosmological evolution from these surveys to explore and discriminate between models. We apply a method to optimally extract this differential information to mock catalogues designed to mimic the eBOSS quasar sample. By applying a set of weights to extract redshift space distortion measurements as a function of redshift, we demonstrate an analysis that does not invoke the problems discussed above. We show that our estimator gives unbiased constraints.},

Our method is substantially different from previous analyses, as it does not rely on direct estimates of star formation rate, but on the differential evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function (SMF). We show the reliability of this approach by means of semi-analytical and hydrodynamical cosmological simulations. We then apply it to real data, using the SMFs derived in the COSMOS and CANDELS fields. We find that the sSFR is proportional to \$(1+z)\^\{1.1$\backslash$pm0.2\}\$ at \$z$>$2\$, in agreement with other observations but in tension with the steeper evolution predicted by simulations from \$z$\backslash$sim4\$ to 2. We investigate the impact of several sources of observational bias, which however cannot account for this discrepancy. Although the SMF of high-redshift galaxies is still affected by significant errors, we show that future large-area surveys will substantially reduce them, making our method an effective tool to probe the massive end of the main sequence of star-forming galaxies.},

From this unique dataset we can connect galaxy samples, selected by stellar mass, to their host dark matter haloes for \$1.5$<$z$<$5.0\$, filling in a large hitherto unexplored region of the parameter space. To interpret the observed galaxy clustering we utilize a phenomenological halo model, combined with a novel method to account for uncertainties arising from the use of photometric redshifts. We find that the satellite fraction decreases with increasing redshift and that the clustering amplitude (e.g., comoving correlation length / large-scale bias) displays monotonic trends with redshift and stellar mass. Applying \$$\backslash$Lambda\$CDM halo mass accretion histories and cumulative abundance arguments for the evolution of stellar mass content we propose pathways for the co-evolution of dark matter and stellar mass assembly. Additionally, we are able to estimate that the halo mass at which the ratio of stellar to halo mass is maximized is \$10\^\{12.5\_\{-0.08\}\^\{+0.10\}\}\$\textasciitilde{}M\$\_\{$\backslash$odot\}\$ at \$z$\backslash$sim2.5\$. This is the first time this peak halo mass has been inferred from stellar mass selected clustering measurements at \$z$\backslash$gtrsim2\$, and implies mild evolution of this quantity for \$z$\backslash$lesssim3\$, consistent with constraints from abundance matching techniques.},

  title = {Painting Galaxies into Dark Matter Halos Using Machine Learning},
  abstract = {We use machine learning (ML) to populate large dark matter-only simulations with baryonic galaxies. Our ML framework takes input halo properties including halo mass, environment, spin, and recent growth history, and outputs central galaxy and overall halo baryonic properties including stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), metallicity, and neutral hydrogen mass. We apply this to the MUFASA cosmological hydrodynamic simulation, and show that it recovers the mean trends of output quantities with halo mass highly accurately, including following the sharp drop in SFR and gas in quenched massive galaxies. However, the scatter around the mean relations is under-predicted. Examining galaxies individually, at \$z=0\$ the stellar mass and metallicity are accurately recovered (\$$\backslash$sigma$\backslash$lesssim 0.2\$\textasciitilde{}dex), but SFR and HI show larger scatter (\$$\backslash$sigma$\backslash$gtrsim 0.3\$\textasciitilde{}dex); these values improve somewhat at \$z=1,2\$. Remarkably, ML quantitatively recovers second parameter trends in galaxy properties, e.g. that galaxies with higher gas content and lower metallicity have higher SFR at a given \$M\_*\$. Testing various ML algorithms, we find that none performs significantly better than the others. Ensembling the algorithms does not fare better, likely because of correlations between the algorithms and the fact that none of the algorithms predict the large observed scatter around the mean properties. For the random forest, we find that halo mass and nearby (\$$\backslash$sim 200\$\textasciitilde{}kpc) environment are the most important predictive variables followed by growth history. We find that halo spin and \$$\backslash$sim\$Mpc scale environment are not. Finally we study the impact of additionally inputting key baryonic properties \$M\_*\$, SFR, and \$Z\$, as would be available e.g. from an equilibrium model, and show that particularly providing the SFR enables HI to be recovered substantially more accurately.},

  title = {Cosmological Constraints from Galaxy Clustering in the Presence of Massive Neutrinos},
  abstract = {The clustering ratio is defined as the ratio between the correlation function and the variance of the smoothed overdensity field. In LCDM cosmologies not accounting for massive neutrinos, it has already been proved to be independent from bias and redshift space distortions on a range of linear scales. It therefore allows for a direct comparison of measurements (from galaxies in redshift space) to predictions (for matter in real space). In this paper we first extend the applicability of such properties of the clustering ratio to cosmologies that include massive neutrinos, by performing tests against simulated data. We then investigate the constraining power of the clustering ratio when cosmological parameters such as the total neutrino mass and the equation of state of dark energy are left free. We analyse the joint posterior distribution of the parameters that must satisfy, at the same time, the measurements of the galaxy clustering ratio in the SDSS DR12, and the angular power spectrum of temperature and polarization anisotropies of the CMB measured by the Planck satellite. We find the clustering ratio to be very sensitive to the CDM density parameter, but not very much so to the total neutrino mass. Lastly, we forecast the constraining power the clustering ratio will achieve with forthcoming surveys, predicting the amplitude of its errors in a Euclid-like galaxy survey. In this case, we find it is expected to improve the constraint at 95\% level on the CDM density by 40\% and on the total neutrino mass by 14\%.},

  abstract = {Galactic conformity is the phenomenon whereby galaxy properties exhibit larger correlations across distance than what would be expected if these properties only depended on halo mass. We perform a comprehensive study of conformity at low redshift using a galaxy group catalogue from the SDSS DR7 spectroscopic sample. We study correlations both between central galaxies and their satellites (1-halo conformity), and between central galaxies in separate haloes (2-halo conformity). We use two statistics, quenched fractions and the marked correlation function, to probe for conformity in three galaxy properties, \$(g-r)\$ colour, specific star formation rate, and S$\backslash$'ersic index. We assess the statistical significance of conformity signals with a suite of mock galaxy catalogues that have no built-in conformity, but contain the same group-finding and mass assignment errors as the real data. In the case of 1-halo conformity, quenched fractions show strong signals at all group masses. However, these signals are equally strong in our mock catalogues, indicating that the conformity signal is spurious and likely entirely caused by systematic errors from group-finding. This result calls into question previous claims of 1-halo conformity detection. The marked correlation function reveals a significant detection of radial segregation within massive groups, but no evidence of conformity. In the case of 2-halo conformity, quenched fractions show no significant evidence of conformity once compared with our mock catalogues, in agreement with recent studies that have cast doubt on the validity of past detections. In contrast, the marked correlation function reveals a highly significant signal in low mass groups for scales of 0.8-4 \$h\^\{-1\}$\backslash$textrm\{Mpc\}\$, possibly representing the first robust detection of 2-halo conformity.},

U-shape anisotropy between elongated and open triangles due to the
effects of velocity dispersion. We show that this shape is quite
universal, very weakly dependent on scale, initial spectral index or
cosmological parameters and should be detectable in current galaxy
surveys even if affected by shot noise or galaxy bias. We present a
detailed method for obtaining constraints on galaxy bias parameters from
measurements of Q3 in current galaxy redshift surveys, based
on the eigenmode analysis similar to that developed for the bispectrum.
We show that our method recovers the bias parameters introduced into
mock galaxies by a halo occupation distribution prescription and is also
able to handle potential systematics in the case when a smaller number
than is ideal for mock catalogues is used to estimate the covariance

Our likelihood passes four objective and cosmology-independent tests which a standard Gaussian likelihood fails. We demonstrate that sound weak lensing analyses are naturally biased low, and this does not indicate any new physics such as deviations from \$$\backslash$Lambda\$CDM. Mathematically, the biases arise because noisy two-point functions follow skewed distributions. This form of bias is already known from CMB analyses, where the low multipoles have asymmetric error bars. Weak lensing is more strongly affected by this asymmetry as galaxies form a discrete set of shear tracer particles, in contrast to a smooth shear field. We demonstrate that the biases can be up to 30 percent of the standard deviation per data point, dependent on the properties of the weak lensing survey. Our likelihood provides a versatile framework with which to address this bias in future weak lensing analyses.},

  abstract = {We present Bayesian Analysis of Galaxies for Physical Inference and Parameter EStimation, or BAGPIPES, a new Python tool which can be used to rapidly generate complex model galaxy spectra and to fit these to arbitrary combinations of spectroscopic and photometric data using the MultiNest algorithm. We extensively test our ability to recover realistic star-formation histories (SFHs) with BAGPIPES by fitting mock observations of quiescent galaxies from the MUFASA simulation. We show that a double-power-law model produces better agreement with realistic SFHs than an exponentially-declining model. We then perform a detailed analysis of the SFHs of a sample of 9312 quiescent galaxies from UltraVISTA with stellar masses, \$M\_* $>$ 10\^\{10\}$\backslash$ $\backslash$mathrm\{M\_$\backslash$odot\}\$ and redshifts \$0.25 $<$ z\_$\backslash$mathrm\{obs\} $<$ 3.75\$. The majority of our quiescent sample exhibit SFHs which rise gradually then quench relatively rapidly, over \$$\backslash$sim 1\{-\}2\$ Gyr. This behaviour is consistent with recent cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, where AGN-driven feedback in the low-accretion (jet) mode is the dominant quenching mechanism. In addition, we identify two further subsets of objects with distinct SFH shapes. At \$z\_$\backslash$mathrm\{obs\} $\backslash$gtrsim 1\$ we find a class of objects with SFHs which rise and fall very rapidly, with quenching timescales of \$$\backslash$lesssim 1\$ Gyr. These objects are consistent with (potentially merger-triggered) quasar-mode AGN feedback. Also, at \$z\_$\backslash$mathrm\{obs\} $\backslash$lesssim 1\$ we find a population with SFHs which quench more slowly than they rise, over \$$\backslash$gtrsim3\$ Gyr, which we speculate to be the result of a 'natural' quenching process, where galaxy SFHs die down gradually due to the diminishing overall cosmic gas supply. Purely passive evolution of the quiescent population at \$z\_$\backslash$mathrm\{obs\} $\backslash$gtrsim 0.5\$ is disfavoured by our results.},

Our five-property classifier identifies disrupted subhalos in the FIRE simulations with \$95$\backslash$\%\$ accuracy. We predict surviving subhalo populations in DMO simulations of the FIRE host halos, finding excellent agreement with the hydrodynamic results; in particular, our classifier outperforms DMO zoom-in simulations that include the gravitational potential of the central galactic disk in each hydrodynamic simulation, indicating that it captures both the dynamical effects of a central disk and additional baryonic physics. We also predict surviving subhalo populations for a suite of DMO zoom-in simulations of MW-mass host halos, finding that baryons impact each system consistently and that the predicted amount of subhalo disruption is larger than the host-to-host scatter among the subhalo populations. Although the small size and specific baryonic physics prescription of our training set limits the generality of our results, our work suggests that machine learning classification algorithms trained on hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations can efficiently predict realistic subhalo populations.},

  abstract = {We quantify the quenching impact of the group environment using the spectroscopic survey GAMA to z=0.2. The fraction of quiescent galaxies (red fraction), whether in groups or isolated, increases with both stellar mass and large-scale (5 Mpc) density. At fixed stellar mass and density, the red fraction of satellites and group centrals is higher than that of isolated galaxies, supporting the idea of "group quenching" rather than satellite quenching. The quenching efficiency with respect to isolated galaxies (a formalism that flattens out the effect of both stellar mass and density) is an increasing function of central color, group stellar mass, and density for satellites of red centrals only, inducing "galactic conformity" : the quenching efficiency is on average higher for satellites of red centrals than of blue centrals. However most of the conformity signal originates from the most massive groups, which reside in the densest environments around the reddest centrals. The star-formation of blue satellites around red centrals in rich/massive groups is also slightly suppressed compared to blue field galaxies of the same mass. In the range of group stellar mass that red and blue centrals have in common, some amount of conformity persists at fixed group stellar mass, independent of density. However, assuming a color-dependent halo-to-stellar-mass ratio, whereby red central galaxies inhabit significantly more massive halos than blue ones of the same stellar mass, we find that conformity disappears entirely at fixed halo mass.},

  abstract = {The energy released by Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in the form of radiation, winds, or radio plasma jets, is known to impact on the surrounding interstellar medium. The result of these processes, known as AGN (negative) feedback, is suggested to prevent gas, in and around galaxies, from cooling, and to remove, or at least redistribute, gas by driving massive and fast outflows, hence playing a key role in galaxy evolution. Given its importance, a large effort is devoted by the astronomical community to trace the effects of AGN on the surrounding gaseous medium and to quantify their impact for different types of AGN. This review briefly summarizes some of the recent observational results obtained in different wavebands, tracing different phases of the gas. I also summarize the new insights they have brought, and the constraints they provide to numerical simulations of galaxy formation and evolution. The recent addition of deep observations of cold gas and, in particular, of cold molecular gas, has brought some interesting surprises and has expanded our understanding of AGN and AGN feedback.},

  shorttitle = {Umbrella Sampling},
  abstract = {We present the umbrella sampling (US) technique and show that it can be used to sample extremely low probability areas of the posterior distribution that may be required in statistical analyses of data. In this approach sampling of the target likelihood is split into sampling of multiple biased likelihoods confined within individual umbrella windows. We show that the US algorithm is efficient and highly parallel and that it can be easily used with other existing MCMC samplers. The method allows the user to capitalize on their intuition and define umbrella windows and increase sampling accuracy along specific directions in the parameter space. Alternatively, one can define umbrella windows using an approach similar to parallel tempering. We provide a public code that implements umbrella sampling as a standalone python package. We present a number of tests illustrating the power of the US method in sampling low probability areas of the posterior and show that this ability allows a considerably more robust sampling of multi-modal distributions compared to the standard sampling methods. We also present an application of the method in a real world example of deriving cosmological constraints using the supernova type Ia data. We show that umbrella sampling can sample the posterior accurately down to the \$$\backslash$approx 15$\backslash$sigma\$ credible region in the \$$\backslash$Omega\_\{$\backslash$rm m\}-$\backslash$Omega\_$\backslash$Lambda\$ plane, while for the same computational work the affine-invariant MCMC sampling implemented in the \{$\backslash$tt emcee\} code samples the posterior reliably only to \$$\backslash$approx 3$\backslash$sigma\$.},

The emulator is built on a sample set of 36 cosmological models, carefully chosen to provide accurate predictions over the wide and large parameter space. For each model, we have performed a high-resolution simulation, augmented with sixteen medium-resolution simulations and TimeRG perturbation theory results to provide accurate coverage of a wide k-range; the dataset generated as part of this project is more than 1.2Pbyte. With the current set of simulated models, we achieve an accuracy of approximately 4\%. Because the sampling approach used here has established convergence and error-control properties, follow-on results with more than a hundred cosmological models will soon achieve \textasciitilde{}1\% accuracy. We compare our approach with other prediction schemes that are based on halo model ideas and remapping approaches. The new emulator code is publicly available.},

  abstract = {The independent component analysis (ICA) of a random vector consists of searching for a linear transformation that minimizes the statistical dependence between its components. In order to define suitable search criteria, the expansion of mutual information is utilized as a function of cumulants of increasing orders. An efficient algorithm is proposed, which allows the computation of the ICA of a data matrix within a polynomial time. The concept of ICA may actually be seen as an extension of the principal component analysis (PCA), which can only impose independence up to the second order and, consequently, defines directions that are orthogonal. Potential applications of ICA include data analysis and compression, Bayesian detection, localization of sources, and blind identification and deconvolution.

Die Analyse unabh\"angiger Komponenten (ICA) eines Vektors beruht auf der Suche nach einer linearen Transformation, die die statistische Abh\"angigkeit zwischen den Komponenten minimiert. Zur Definition geeigneter Such-Kriterien wird die Entwicklung gemeinsamer Information als Funktion von Kumulanten steigender Ordnung genutzt. Es wird ein effizienter Algorithmus vorgeschlagen, der die Berechnung der ICA f\"ur Datenmatrizen innerhalb einer polynomischen Zeit erlaubt. Das Konzept der ICA kann eigentlich als Erweiterung der `Principal Component Analysis` (PCA) betrachtet werden, die nur die Unabh\"angigkeit bis zur zweiten Ordnung erzwingen kann und deshalb Richtungen definiert, die orthogonal sind. Potentielle Anwendungen der ICA beinhalten Daten-Analyse und Kompression, Bayes-Detektion, Quellenlokalisierung und blinde Identifikation und Entfaltung.

We use a combination of two different approaches for linear ICA: Comon's information theoretic approach and the projection pursuit approach. Using maximum entropy approximations of differential entropy, we introduce a family of new contrast functions for ICA. These contrast functions enable both the estimation of the whole decomposition by minimizing mutual information, and estimation of individual independent components as projection pursuit directions. The statistical properties of the estimators based on such contrast functions are analyzed under the assumption of the linear mixture model, and it is shown how to choose contrast functions that are robust and/or of minimum variance. Finally, we introduce simple fixed-point algorithms for practical optimization of the contrast functions.},

Standard weighted least-squares fitting is only appropriate when there is a dimension along which the data points have negligible uncertainties, and another along which all the
uncertainties can be described by Gaussians of known variance; these conditions are rarely met in practice. We consider cases of general, heterogeneous, and arbitrarily covariant two-dimensional uncertainties, and situations in which there are bad data (large outliers), unknown uncertainties, and unknown but expected intrinsic scatter in the linear relationship being fit. Above all we emphasize the importance of having a "generative model" for the data, even an approximate one. Once there is a generative model, the subsequent fitting is non-arbitrary because the model permits direct computation of the likelihood of the parameters or the posterior probability distribution. Construction of a posterior probability distribution is indispensible if there are "nuisance parameters" to marginalize away.},

  abstract = {Understanding the nature of dark energy, the mysterious force driving the accelerated expansion of the Universe, is a major challenge of modern cosmology. The next generation of cosmological surveys, specifically designed to address this issue, rely on accurate measurements of the apparent shapes of distant galaxies. However, shape measurement methods suffer from various unavoidable biases and therefore will rely on a precise calibration to meet the accuracy requirements of the science analysis. This calibration process remains an open challenge as it requires large sets of high quality galaxy images. To this end, we study the application of deep conditional generative models in generating realistic galaxy images. In particular we consider variations on conditional variational autoencoder and introduce a new adversarial objective for training of conditional generative networks. Our results suggest a reliable alternative to the acquisition of expensive high quality observations for generating the calibration data needed by the next generation of cosmological surveys.},

  abstract = {We investigate machine learning (ML) techniques for predicting the number of galaxies (N\_gal) that occupy a halo, given the halo's properties. These types of mappings are crucial for constructing the mock galaxy catalogs necessary for analyses of large-scale structure. The ML techniques proposed here distinguish themselves from traditional halo occupation distribution (HOD) modeling as they do not assume a prescribed relationship between halo properties and N\_gal. In addition, our ML approaches are only dependent on parent halo properties (like HOD methods), which are advantageous over subhalo-based approaches as identifying subhalos correctly is difficult. We test 2 algorithms: support vector machines (SVM) and k-nearest-neighbour (kNN) regression. We take galaxies and halos from the Millennium simulation and predict N\_gal by training our algorithms on the following 6 halo properties: number of particles, M\_200, $\backslash$sigma\_v, v\_max, half-mass radius and spin. For Millennium, our predicted N\_gal values have a mean-squared-error (MSE) of \textasciitilde{}0.16 for both SVM and kNN. Our predictions match the overall distribution of halos reasonably well and the galaxy correlation function at large scales to \textasciitilde{}5-10\%. In addition, we demonstrate a feature selection algorithm to isolate the halo parameters that are most predictive, a useful technique for understanding the mapping between halo properties and N\_gal. Lastly, we investigate these ML-based approaches in making mock catalogs for different galaxy subpopulations (e.g. blue, red, high M\_star, low M\_star). Given its non-parametric nature as well as its powerful predictive and feature selection capabilities, machine learning offers an interesting alternative for creating mock catalogs.},

  abstract = {We present cluster counts and corresponding cosmological constraints from the \emph{Planck\emph{ full mission data set. Our catalogue consists of 439 clusters detected via their Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) signal down to a signal-to-noise ratio of 6, and is more than a factor of 2 larger than the 2013 \emph{Planck\emph{ cluster cosmology sample. The counts are consistent with those from 2013 and yield compatible constraints under the same modelling assumptions. Taking advantage of the larger catalogue, we extend our analysis to the two-dimensional distribution in redshift and signal-to-noise. We use mass estimates from two recent studies of gravitational lensing of background galaxies by \emph{Planck\emph{ clusters to provide priors on the hydrostatic bias parameter, (1-\emph{b\emph{). In addition, we use lensing of cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature fluctuations by \emph{Planck\emph{ clusters as an independent constraint on this parameter. These various calibrations imply constraints on the present-day amplitude of matter fluctuations in varying degrees of tension with those from the \emph{Planck\emph{ analysis of primary fluctuations in the CMB; for the lowest estimated values of (1-\emph{b\emph{) the tension is mild, only a little over one standard deviation, while it remains substantial (3.7\emph{$\sigma$\emph{) for the largest estimated value. We also examine constraints on extensions to the base flat $\Lambda$CDM model by combining the cluster and CMB constraints. The combination appears to favour non-minimal neutrino masses, but this possibility does little to relieve the overall tension because it simultaneously lowers the implied value of the Hubble parameter, thereby exacerbating the discrepancy with most current astrophysical estimates. Improving the precision of cluster mass calibrations from the current 10\%-level to 1\% would significantly strengthen these combined analyses and provide a stringent test of the base $\Lambda$CDM model.}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}},

  doi = {10.1086/308059},
  abstract = {Gravitational clustering is an intrinsically nonlinear process that generates significant non-Gaussian signatures in the density field. We consider how these affect power spectrum determinations from galaxy and weak-lensing surveys. Non-Gaussian effects not only increase the individual error bars compared to the Gaussian case but, most
importantly, lead to nontrivial cross-correlations between different band powers, correlating small-scale band powers both among themselves and with those at large scales. We calculate the power-spectrum
covariance matrix in nonlinear perturbation theory (weakly nonlinear regime), in the hierarchical model (strongly nonlinear regime), and from numerical simulations in real and redshift space. In particular, we show that the hierarchical Ansatz cannot be strictly valid for the
configurations of the trispectrum involved in the calculation of the power-spectrum covariance matrix. We discuss the impact of these results on parameter estimation from power-spectrum measurements and their dependence on the size of the survey and the choice of band powers. We show that the non-Gaussian terms in the covariance matrix become dominant for scales smaller than the nonlinear scale knl\textasciitilde{}0.2 h-1 Mpc-1, depending somewhat on power
normalization. Furthermore, we find that cross-correlations mostly deteriorate the determination of the amplitude of a rescaled power spectrum, whereas its shape is less affected. In weak lensing surveys the projection tends to reduce the importance of non-Gaussian effects. Even so, for background galaxies at redshift z\textasciitilde{}1, the non-Gaussian contribution rises significantly around l\textasciitilde{}1000 and could become
comparable to the Gaussian terms depending upon the power spectrum normalization and cosmology. The projection has another interesting effect: the ratio between non-Gaussian and Gaussian contributions saturates and can even decrease at small enough angular scales if the power spectrum of the three-dimensional field falls faster than
k-2.},

  abstract = {We develop a method for estimating the shear power spectra from weak-lensing observations and test it on simulated data. Our method describes the shear field in terms of angular power spectra and the cross-correlation of the two shear modes, which differ under parity transformations. Two of the three power spectra can be used to monitor unknown sources of noise in the data. The power spectra are decomposed in a model-independent manner in terms of ‘‘band powers,'' which are then extracted from the data using a quadratic estimator to find the maximum of the likelihood and its local curvature (for error estimates). We test the method against simulated data from Gaussian realizations and cosmological N-body simulations. In the Gaussian case, the mean band powers and their covariance are well recovered even for irregular (or sparsely) sampled fields. The mild non-Gaussianity of the N-body realizations causes a slight underestimation of the errors that becomes negligible for scales much larger than several arcminutes and does not bias the recovered band powers. These techniques can also be directly applied to cosmic microwave background polarization E and B mode analyses on small fields.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the \emph{Planck\emph{ 2013 likelihood, a complete statistical description of the two-point correlation function of the CMB temperature fluctuations that accounts for all known relevant uncertainties, both instrumental and astrophysical in nature. We use this likelihood to derive our best estimate of the CMB angular power spectrum from \emph{Planck\emph{ over three decades in multipole moment, \emph{$\mathscr{l}$\emph{, covering 2 $\leq$ \emph{$\mathscr{l}$\emph{ $\leq$ 2500. The main source of uncertainty at \emph{$\mathscr{l}$\emph{ $\lessequivlnt$ 1500 is cosmic variance. Uncertainties in small-scale foreground modelling and instrumental noise dominate the error budget at higher \emph{$\mathscr{l}$\emph{s. For \emph{$\mathscr{l}$\emph{ $<$ 50, our likelihood exploits all \emph{Planck\emph{ frequency channels from 30 to 353 GHz, separating the cosmological CMB signal from diffuse Galactic foregrounds through a physically motivated Bayesian component separation technique. At \emph{$\mathscr{l}$\emph{ $\geq$ 50, we employ a correlated Gaussian likelihood approximation based on a fine-grained set of angular cross-spectra derived from multiple detector combinations between the 100, 143, and 217 GHz frequency channels, marginalising over power spectrum foreground templates. We validate our likelihood through an extensive suite of consistency tests, and assess the impact of residual foreground and instrumental uncertainties on the final cosmological parameters. We find good internal agreement among the high-\emph{$\mathscr{l}$\emph{ cross-spectra with residuals below a few \emph{$\mu$\emph{K\textsuperscript{2\textsuperscript{ at \emph{$\mathscr{l}$\emph{ $\lessequivlnt$ 1000, in agreement with estimated calibration uncertainties. We compare our results with foreground-cleaned CMB maps derived from all \emph{Planck\emph{ frequencies, as well as with cross-spectra derived from the 70 GHz \emph{Planck\emph{ map, and find broad agreement in terms of spectrum residuals and cosmological parameters. We further show that the best-fit $\Lambda$CDM cosmology is in excellent agreement with preliminary \emph{Planck\emph{\emph{EE\emph{ and \emph{TE\emph{ polarisation spectra. We find that the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology is well constrained by \emph{Planck\emph{ from the measurements at \emph{$\mathscr{l}$\emph{ $\lessequivlnt$ 1500. One specific example is the spectral index of scalar perturbations, for which we report a 5.4\emph{$\sigma$\emph{ deviation from scale invariance, \emph{n\emph{\textsubscript{s\textsubscript{ = 1. Increasing the multipole range beyond \emph{$\mathscr{l}$\emph{ $\simeq$ 1500 does not increase our accuracy for the $\Lambda$CDM parameters, but instead allows us to study extensions beyond the standard model. We find no indication of significant departures from the $\Lambda$CDM framework. Finally, we report a tension between the \emph{Planck\emph{ best-fit $\Lambda$CDM model and the low-\emph{$\mathscr{l}$\emph{ spectrum in the form of a power deficit of 5\textendash{}10\% at \emph{$\mathscr{l}$\emph{ $\lessequivlnt$ 40, with a statistical significance of 2.5\textendash{}3\emph{$\sigma$\emph{.

Likelihood-free inference methods allow us to perform Bayesian inference from these models using only forward simulations, free from any likelihood assumptions or approximations. Likelihood-free inference generically involves simulating mock data and comparing to the observed data; this comparison in data-space suffers from the curse of dimensionality and requires compression of the data to a small number of summary statistics to be tractable. In this paper we use massive optimal data compression to reduce the dimensionality of the data-space to just one number per parameter, providing a natural and optimal framework for summary statistic choice for likelihood-free inference. Secondly, we introduce density estimation likelihood-free inference, which learns a parameterized model for joint distribution of data and parameters, yielding both the parameter posterior and the model evidence. This approach is conceptually simple, requires less tuning than traditional Approximate Bayesian Computation approaches to likelihood-free inference and can give high-fidelity posteriors from orders of magnitude fewer forward simulations. As an additional bonus, it enables parameter inference and Bayesian model comparison simultaneously. We demonstrate density estimation likelihood-free inference with massive data compression on an analysis of the joint light-curve analysis supernova data. We show that high-fidelity posterior inference is possible for full-scale cosmological data analyses with as few as \$$\backslash$sim 10\^4\$ simulations, with substantial scope for further improvement, demonstrating the scalability of likelihood-free inference to large and complex cosmological datasets.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the \emph{Planck\emph{ 2015 likelihoods, statistical descriptions of the 2-point correlationfunctions of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and polarization fluctuations that account for relevant uncertainties, both instrumental and astrophysical in nature. They are based on the same hybrid approach used for the previous release, i.e., a pixel-based likelihood at low multipoles (\emph{$\mathscr{l}$\emph{$<$ 30) and a Gaussian approximation to the distribution of cross-power spectra at higher multipoles. The main improvements are the use of more and better processed data and of \emph{Planck\emph{ polarization information, along with more detailed models of foregrounds and instrumental uncertainties. The increased redundancy brought by more than doubling the amount of data analysed enables further consistency checks and enhanced immunity to systematic effects. It also improves the constraining power of \emph{Planck\emph{, in particular with regard to small-scale foreground properties. Progress in the modelling of foreground emission enables the retention of a larger fraction of the sky to determine the properties of the CMB, which also contributes to the enhanced precision of the spectra. Improvements in data processing and instrumental modelling further reduce uncertainties. Extensive tests establish the robustness and accuracy of the likelihood results, from temperature alone, from polarization alone, and from their combination. For temperature, we also perform a full likelihood analysis of realistic end-to-end simulations of the instrumental response to the sky, which were fed into the actual data processing pipeline; this does not reveal biases from residual low-level instrumental systematics. Even with the increase in precision and robustness, the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model continues to offer a very good fit to the \emph{Planck\emph{ data. The slope of the primordial scalar fluctuations, \emph{n\emph{\textsubscript{s\textsubscript{, is confirmed smaller than unity at more than 5\emph{$\sigma$\emph{ from \emph{Planck\emph{ alone. We further validate the robustness of the likelihood results against specific extensions to the baseline cosmology, which are particularly sensitive to data at high multipoles. For instance, the effective number of neutrino species remains compatible with the canonical value of 3.046. For this first detailed analysis of \emph{Planck\emph{ polarization spectra, we concentrate at high multipoles on the \emph{E\emph{ modes, leaving the analysis of the weaker \emph{B\emph{ modes to future work. At low multipoles we use temperature maps at all \emph{Planck\emph{ frequencies along with a subset of polarization data. These data take advantage of \emph{Planck\emph{'s wide frequency coverage to improve the separation of CMB and foreground emission. Within the baseline $\Lambda$CDM cosmology this requires \emph{$\tau$\emph{ = 0.078 $\pm$ 0.019 for the reionization optical depth, which is significantly lower than estimates without the use of high-frequency data for explicit monitoring of dust emission. At high multipoles we detect residual systematic errors in \emph{E\emph{ polarization, typically at the \emph{$\mu$\emph{K\textsuperscript{2\textsuperscript{ level; we therefore choose to retain temperature information alone for high multipoles as the recommended baseline, in particular for testing non-minimal models. Nevertheless, the high-multipole polarization spectra from \emph{Planck\emph{ are already good enough to enable a separate high-precision determination of the parameters of the $\Lambda$CDM model, showing consistency with those established independently from temperature information alone.}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}},

  abstract = {It is widely believed that maximum-likelihood estimators must be used to 
provide optimal estimates of power spectra. Since such estimators
require the inversion and multiplication of
Nd\texttimes{}Nd matrices, where Nd is the
size of the data vector, maximum-likelihood estimators require at least
of order N3d operations and become computationally
prohibitive for Nd greater than a few tens of thousands.
Because of this, a large and inhomogeneous literature exists on
approximate methods of power-spectrum estimation. These range from
manifestly suboptimal but computationally fast methods, to near-optimal
but computationally expensive methods. Furthermore, much of this
literature concentrates on the power-spectrum estimates rather than the
equally important problem of deriving an accurate covariance matrix. In
this paper, I consider the problem of estimating the power spectrum of
cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies from large data sets.
Various analytic results on power-spectrum estimators are derived, or
collated from the literature, and tested against numerical simulations.
An unbiased hybrid estimator is proposed that combines a
maximum-likelihood estimator at low multipoles and pseudo-Cl
estimates at high multipoles. The hybrid estimator is computationally
fast (i.e. it can be run on a laptop computer for Planck-sized data
sets), nearly optimal over the full range of multipoles, and returns an
accurate and nearly diagonal covariance matrix for realistic
experimental configurations (provided certain conditions on the noise
properties of the experiment are satisfied). It is argued that, in
practice, computationally expensive methods that approximate the
maximum-likelihood solution are unlikely to improve on the hybrid
estimator, and may actually perform worse. The results presented here
can be generalized to CMB polarization and to power-spectrum estimation
using other types of data, such as galaxy clustering and weak
gravitational lensing.},

  abstract = {This paper generalizes the hybrid power spectrum estimation method 
developed in a previous paper to the estimation of polarization power
spectra of the cosmic microwave background radiation. The hybrid power

constraints. Furthermore, the hybrid estimator is computationally fast
and can easily be incorporated in a Monte Carlo chain for Planck-sized
data sets, which may be essential to account for realistic noise
covariance and systematic errors. Simple formulae are given for the
covariance matrices, including uncorrelated inhomogeneous instrumental
noise, and these are tested extensively against numerical simulations.
We compare the behaviour of simple pseudo-Cl (PCL) estimates
with maximum-likelihood estimates at low multipoles. For realistic sky
cuts, maximum-likelihood estimates reduce very significantly the mixing
of E and B modes. To achieve limits on the scalar-tensor ratio of r
$<<$ 0.1 from sky maps with realistic sky cuts, maximum-likelihood
methods, or PCL estimators based on unambiguous E and B modes, will be
essential.},

It allows us to accurately follow the density field for both Cold Dark Matter (CDM) and neutrinos at both high and low redshifts. At high redshifts, the new method is able to reduce the shot noise in the neutrino power spectrum by a factor of more than \$10\^7\$ compared to previous methods, where the power spectrum was dominated by shot noise at all scales. We find that our new approach also helps to reduce the noise on the total matter power spectrum on large scales, whereas on small scales the results agree with previous simulations. Our new method also allows for a systematic study of clustering of the low velocity tail of the distribution function of neutrinos. This method also allows for the study of the evolution of the overall velocity distribution as a function of the environment determined by the CDM field.},

  abstract = {We empirically constrain how galaxy size relates to halo virial radius using new measurements of the size- and stellar mass-dependent clustering of galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We find that small galaxies cluster much more strongly than large galaxies of the same stellar mass. The magnitude of this clustering difference increases on small scales, and decreases with increasing stellar mass. Using Halotools to forward model the observations, we test an empirical model in which present-day galaxy size is proportional to the size of the virial radius at the time the halo reached its maximum mass. This simple model reproduces the observed size-dependence of galaxy clustering in striking detail. The success of this model provides strong support for the conclusion that satellite galaxies have smaller sizes relative to central galaxies of the same halo mass. Our findings indicate that satellite size is set prior to the time of infall, and that a remarkably simple, linear size--virial radius relation emerges from the complex physics regulating galaxy size. We make quantitative predictions for future measurements of galaxy-galaxy lensing, including dependence upon size, scale, and stellar mass, and provide a scaling relation of the ratio of mean sizes of satellites and central galaxies as a function of their halo mass that can be used to calibrate hydrodynamical simulations and semi-analytic models.},

  abstract = {The physical origin of the large-scale conformity in the colours and specific star formation rates of isolated low mass central galaxies and their neighbours on scales in excess of 1 Mpc is still under debate. One possible scenario is that gas is heated over large scales by feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN), leading to coherent modulation of cooling and star formation between well-separated galaxies. In this Letter, the metal line absorption catalogue of Zhu \& Menard (2013) is used to probe gas out to large projected radii around a sample of a million galaxies with stellar masses \textasciitilde{}10\^\{10\} M\_\{sun\} and photometric redshifts in the range 0.4$<$z$<$0.8 selected from Sloan Digital Sky Survey imaging data. This galaxy sample covers an effective volume of 2.2 Gpc\^3. A statistically significant excess of MgII absorbers is present around the red low mass galaxies compared to their blue counterparts out to projected radii of 10 Mpc. In addition, the equivalent width distribution function of MgII absorbers around low mass galaxies is shown to be strongly affected by the presence of a nearby (R\_p$<$2 Mpc) radio-loud AGN out to projected radii of 5 Mpc.},

  title = {An Accurate Linear Model for Redshift Space Distortions in the Void-Galaxy Correlation Function},
  abstract = {Redshift space distortions within voids provide a unique method to test for environmental dependence of the growth rate of structures in low density regions, where effects of modified gravity theories might be important. We derive a linear theory model for the redshift space void-galaxy correlation that is valid at all pair separations, including deep within the void, and use this to obtain expressions for the monopole \$$\backslash$xi\^s\_0\$ and quadrupole \$$\backslash$xi\^s\_2\$ contributions. Our derivation highlights terms that have previously been neglected but are important within the void interior. As a result our model differs from previous works and predicts new physical effects, including a change in the sign of the quadrupole term within the void radius. We show how the model can be generalised to include a velocity dispersion. We compare our model predictions to measurements of the correlation function using mock void and galaxy catalogues modelled after the BOSS CMASS galaxy sample using the Big MultiDark N-body simulation, and show that the linear model with dispersion provides an excellent fit to the data at all scales, \$0$\backslash$leq s$\backslash$leq120$\backslash$;h\^\{-1\}\$Mpc. While the RSD model matches simulations, the linear bias approximation does not hold within voids, and care is needed in fitting for the growth rate. Assuming a constant velocity dispersion, fits to the quadrupole recover the growth rate \$f\$ to a precision of \$4$\backslash$\%\$ using the simulation volume of \$(2.5$\backslash$;h\^\{-1\}$\backslash$mathrm\{Gpc\})\^3\$ at \$z=0.52\$.},

  abstract = {Current constraints on models of galaxy evolution rely on morphometric catalogs extracted from multi-band photometric surveys. However, these catalogs are altered by selection effects that are difficult to model, that correlate in non trivial ways, and that can lead to contradictory predictions if not taken into account carefully. To address this issue, we have developed a new approach combining parametric Bayesian indirect likelihood (pBIL) techniques and empirical modeling with realistic image simulations that reproduce a large fraction of these selection effects. This allows us to perform a direct comparison between observed and simulated images and to infer robust constraints on model parameters. We use a semi-empirical forward model to generate a distribution of mock galaxies from a set of physical parameters. These galaxies are passed through an image simulator reproducing the instrumental characteristics of any survey and are then extracted in the same way as the observed data. The discrepancy between the simulated and observed data is quantified, and minimized with a custom sampling process based on adaptive Monte Carlo Markov Chain methods. Using synthetic data matching most of the properties of a CFHTLS Deep field, we demonstrate the robustness and internal consistency of our approach by inferring the parameters governing the size and luminosity functions and their evolutions for different realistic populations of galaxies. We also compare the results of our approach with those obtained from the classical spectral energy distribution fitting and photometric redshift approach.Our pipeline infers efficiently the luminosity and size distribution and evolution parameters with a very limited number of observables (3 photometric bands). When compared to SED fitting based on the same set of observables, our method yields results that are more accurate and free from systematic biases.},

  abstract = {We use a volume-limited galaxy sample from the SDSS Data Release 7 to explore the environmental effect on the large-scale galactic conformity (4Mpc). We find the activity of neighbour galaxies depends more strongly on their environments than on the activity of their primary galaxies. In under-dense regions most neighbour galaxies tend to be active, while in over-dense regions neighbour galaxies are mostly passive, regardless of the activity of their primary galaxies. It is the different spatial distributions of active and passive primary galaxies that leads to the apparent strong conformity signal. The activity of neighbour galaxies in different environments can be explained by the corresponding fraction of satellite galaxies. Similar results are found for semi-analytical galaxies, suggesting no new physics is required to explain the observed large-scale conformity.},

While their free parameters have been calibrated to the same observational data sets using two approaches, they nevertheless retain some 'memory' of any previous calibration that served as the starting point (especially for the manually-tuned models). For the first calibration, models reproduce the observed z = 0 galaxy stellar mass function (SMF) within 3-\{$\backslash$sigma\}. The second calibration extended the observational data to include the z = 2 SMF alongside the z\textasciitilde{}0 star formation rate function, cold gas mass and the black hole-bulge mass relation. Encapsulating the observed evolution of the SMF from z = 2 to z = 0 is found to be very hard within the context of the physics currently included in the models. We finally use our calibrated models to study the evolution of the stellar-to-halo mass (SHM) ratio. For all models we find that the peak value of the SHM relation decreases with redshift. However, the trends seen for the evolution of the peak position as well as the mean scatter in the SHM relation are rather weak and strongly model dependent. Both the calibration data sets and model results are publicly available.},

  title = {Neutrino {{Mass Priors}} for {{Cosmology}} from {{Random Matrices}}},
  abstract = {Cosmological measurements of structure are placing increasingly strong constraints on the sum of the neutrino masses, \$$\backslash$Sigma m\_$\backslash$nu\$, through Bayesian inference. Because these constraints depend on the choice for the prior probability \$$\backslash$pi($\backslash$Sigma m\_$\backslash$nu)\$, we argue that this prior should be motivated by fundamental physical principles rather than the ad hoc choices that are common in the literature. The first step in this direction is to specify the prior directly at the level of the neutrino mass matrix \$M\_$\backslash$nu\$, since this is the parameter appearing in the Lagrangian of the particle physics theory. Thus by specifying a probability distribution over \$M\_$\backslash$nu\$, and by including the known squared mass splittings, we predict a theoretical probability distribution over \$$\backslash$Sigma m\_$\backslash$nu\$ that we interpret as a Bayesian prior probability \$$\backslash$pi($\backslash$Sigma m\_$\backslash$nu)\$. We find that \$$\backslash$pi($\backslash$Sigma m\_$\backslash$nu)\$ peaks close to the smallest \$$\backslash$Sigma m\_$\backslash$nu\$ allowed by the measured mass splittings, roughly \$0.06 $\backslash$, \{$\backslash$rm eV\}\$ (\$0.1 $\backslash$, \{$\backslash$rm eV\}\$) for normal (inverted) ordering, due to the phenomenon of eigenvalue repulsion in random matrices. We consider three models for neutrino mass generation: Dirac, Majorana, and Majorana via the seesaw mechanism; differences in the predicted priors \$$\backslash$pi($\backslash$Sigma m\_$\backslash$nu)\$ allow for the possibility of having indications about the physical origin of neutrino masses once sufficient experimental sensitivity is achieved. We present fitting functions for \$$\backslash$pi($\backslash$Sigma m\_$\backslash$nu)\$, which provide a simple means for applying these priors to cosmological constraints on the neutrino masses or marginalizing over their impact on other cosmological parameters.},

We use this information to constrain the distribution of dark matter around cluster member galaxies, simultaneously with the cluster's large-scale mass distribution. We find tentative evidence that some galaxies' dark matter has surprisingly similar ellipticity to their stars (unlike in the field, where it is more spherical), but that its orientation is often misaligned. When non-coincident dark matter and baryonic halos are allowed, the model improves by 35$\backslash$\%. This technique may provide a new way to investigate the processes and timescales on which dark matter is stripped from galaxies as they fall into a massive cluster. Our preliminary conclusions will be made more robust by analysing the remaining five $\backslash$emph\{Frontier Field\} clusters.},

  abstract = {The initial mass function (IMF) is a key ingredient in many studies of galaxy formation and evolution. Although the IMF is often assumed to be universal, there is continuing evidence that it is not universal. Spectroscopic studies that derive the IMF of the unresolved stellar populations of a galaxy often assume that this spectrum can be described by a single stellar population (SSP). To alleviate these limitations, in this paper we have developed a unique hierarchical Bayesian framework for modelling composite stellar populations (CSPs). Within this framework we use a parameterized IMF prior to regulate a direct inference of the IMF. We use this new framework to determine the number of SSPs that is required to fit a set of realistic CSP mock spectra. The CSP mock spectra that we use are based on semi-analytic models and have an IMF that varies as a function of stellar velocity dispersion of the galaxy. Our results suggest that using a single SSP biases the determination of the IMF slope to a higher value than the true slope, although the trend with stellar velocity dispersion is overall recovered. If we include more SSPs in the fit, the Bayesian evidence increases significantly and the inferred IMF slopes of our mock spectra converge, within the errors, to their true values. Most of the bias is already removed by using two SSPs instead of one. We show that we can reconstruct the variable IMF of our mock spectra for signal-to-noise ratios exceeding \$$\backslash$sim\$75.},

  abstract = {We conducted an analysis on dark matter halo properties following major and minor mergers to advance our understanding of halo evolution. In this work, we analyzed \textasciitilde{}80,000 dark matter halos from the Bolshoi-Planck cosmological simulation and studied halo evolution during relaxation after major mergers, those in which the merging mass ratio m/M $>$ 0.3. We then applied a Gaussian filter to the property evolutions and characterized peak distributions, frequencies, and variabilities for several halo properties, including centering, spin, shape (prolateness), scale radius, and virial ratio. However, there were also halos that experienced relaxation without the presence of major mergers. We hypothesized that this was due to minor mergers unrecorded by the simulation analysis. By using property peaks to create a novel merger detection algorithm, we attempted to find minor mergers and match them to the unaccounted relaxed halos. Not only did we find evidence that minor mergers were the causes, but we also found similarities between major and minor merger effects, showing the significance of minor mergers for future studies. Through our dark matter merger statistics, we expect our work to ultimately serve as vital parameters towards better understanding galaxy formation and evolution.},

  abstract = {A large variance exists in the amplitude of the Stellar Mass - Halo Mass (SMHM) relation for group and cluster-size halos. We show that the magnitude gap between the brightest central galaxy (BCG) and its second or fourth brightest neighbor accounts for a significant portion of this variance. We find that at fixed halo mass, galaxy clusters with a higher magnitude gap have a higher BCG stellar mass. This relationship is also observed in semi-analytic representations of low-redshift galaxy clusters in simulations. This SMHM-magnitude gap stratification likely results from BCG growth via hierarchical mergers and may link assembly of the halo with the growth of the BCG. Using a Bayesian model, we quantify the importance of the magnitude gap in the SMHM relation using a stretch factor, which we find to be significantly non-zero. The inclusion of the magnitude gap in the SMHM relation results in a large reduction in the inferred intrinsic scatter in the BCG stellar mass at fixed halo mass. We discuss the ramifications of this result in the context of galaxy formation models of centrals in group and cluster-sized halos.},

  abstract = {We present results from the semi-analytic model of galaxy formation SAG applied on the MultiDark simulation MDPL2. SAG features an updated supernova (SN) feedback scheme and a robust modelling of the environmental effects on satellite galaxies. This incorporates a gradual starvation of the hot gas halo driven by the action of ram pressure stripping (RPS), that can affect the cold gas disc, and tidal stripping (TS), which can act on all baryonic components. Galaxy orbits of orphan satellites are integrated providing adequate positions and velocities for the estimation of RPS and TS. The star formation history and stellar mass assembly of galaxies are sensitive to the redshift dependence implemented in the SN feedback model. We discuss a variant of our model that allows to reconcile the predicted star formation rate density at \$z $\backslash$gtrsim 3\$ with the observed one, at the expense of an excess in the faint end of the stellar mass function at \$z=2\$. The fractions of passive galaxies as a function of stellar mass, halo mass and the halo-centric distances are consistent with observational measurements. The model also reproduces the evolution of the main sequence of star forming central and satellite galaxies. The similarity between them is a result of the gradual starvation of the hot gas halo suffered by satellites, in which RPS plays a dominant role. RPS of the cold gas does not affect the fraction of quenched satellites but it contributes to reach the right atomic hydrogen gas content for more massive satellites (\$M\_\{$\backslash$star\}$\backslash$gtrsim 10\^\{10\}$\backslash$,\{$\backslash$rm M\}\_\{$\backslash$odot\}\$).},

For a given stellar mass, SF quenching is less efficient in galaxies accreted by lower mass haloes both before and after first infall, because of the lower efficiency of both environmental and mass quenching processes, in contradiction with analysis of observational data. Quenching time-scales estimated for satellites that are active at first infall support the delay-then-rapid quenching scenario. The environment dominates the period of delayed quenching acting on the hot gas, while mass quenching is responsible for the fast decline of SF as the cold gas is consumed. The former stage is characterized by delay time-scales that range from \$$\backslash$approx 4$\backslash$,\{$\backslash$rm Gyr\}\$ to \$$\backslash$approx 0.5$\backslash$,\{$\backslash$rm Gyr\}\$ for low (\$M\_\{$\backslash$star\} $\backslash$approx 10\^\{10\}$\backslash$, \{$\backslash$rm M\}\_\{$\backslash$odot\}\$) and high (\$M\_\{$\backslash$star\} $\backslash$approx 10\^\{11\}$\backslash$, \{$\backslash$rm M\}\_\{$\backslash$odot\}\$) mass satellites, respectively.

  abstract = {The streaming model describes the mapping between real and redshift space for 2-point clustering statistics. Its key element is the probability density function (PDF) of line-of-sight pairwise peculiar velocities. Following a kinetic-theory approach, we derive the fundamental equations of the streaming model for ordered and unordered pairs. In the first case, we recover the classic equation while we demonstrate that modifications are necessary for unordered pairs. The difference originates from pairs that reverse their line-of-sight ordering between real and redshift space with respect to the observer. Our non-perturbative results are exact in the distant-observer approximation and hold true also in the presence of multi streaming. We clarify some ambiguity in the literature by showing that different pairwise-velocity PDFs should be employed for ordered and unordered pairs. We then discuss several statistical properties of the pairwise velocities also using a high-resolution N-body simulation. Finally, we introduce a mixture of Gaussians which is known in statistics as the generalised hyperbolic distribution and show that it provides an accurate fit to the PDF of pairwise velocities. Once inserted in the streaming equation, the fit yields an excellent description of redshift-space correlations at all scales that vastly outperforms the commonly used Gaussian and exponential approximations. Using a principal-component analysis, we reduce the complexity of our model for large redshift-space separations. Our results are useful for extending studies of anisotropic galaxy clustering towards smaller scales in order to test theories of gravity and interacting dark-energy models.},

  abstract = {We propose a new methodology aimed at finding star-forming galaxies in the phase which immediately follows the star-formation (SF) quenching, based on the use of high- to low-ionization emission line ratios. These ratios rapidly disappear after the SF halt, due to the softening of the UV ionizing radiation. We focus on [O III] \$$\backslash$lambda\$5007/H\$$\backslash$alpha\$ and [Ne III] \$$\backslash$lambda\$3869/[O II] \$$\backslash$lambda\$3727, studying them with simulations obtained with the CLOUDY photoionization code. If a sharp quenching is assumed, we find that the two ratios are very sensitive tracers as they drop by a factor \$$\backslash$sim\$ 10 within \$$\backslash$sim\$ 10 Myr from the interruption of the SF; instead, if a smoother and slower SF decline is assumed (i.e. an exponentially declining star-formation history with \$e\$-folding time \$$\backslash$tau=\$ 200 Myr), they decrease by a factor \$$\backslash$sim\$ 2 within \$$\backslash$sim\$ 80 Myr. We mitigate the ionization -- metallicity degeneracy affecting our methodology using pairs of emission line ratios separately related to metallicity and ionization, adopting the [N II] \$$\backslash$lambda\$6584/[O II] \$$\backslash$lambda\$3727 ratio as metallicity diagnostic. Using a Sloan Digital Sky Survey galaxy sample, we identify 10 examples among the most extreme quenching candidates within the [O III] \$$\backslash$lambda\$5007/H\$$\backslash$alpha\$ vs. [N II] \$$\backslash$lambda\$6584/[O II] \$$\backslash$lambda\$3727 plane, characterized by low [O III] \$$\backslash$lambda\$5007/H\$$\backslash$alpha\$, faint [Ne III] \$$\backslash$lambda\$3869, and by blue dust-corrected spectra and \$(u-r)\$ colours, as expected if the SF quenching has occurred in the very recent past. Our results also suggest that the observed fractions of quenching candidates can be used to constrain the quenching mechanism at work and its time-scales.},

  title = {Cosmic Web Dependence of Galaxy Clustering and Quenching in {{SDSS}}},
  abstract = {Galaxies exhibit different clustering and quenching properties in clusters, filaments, and the field, but it is still uncertain whether such differences are imprints of the tidal environment on galaxy formation, or if they reflect the variation of the underlying halo mass function across the cosmic web. We measure the dependence of galaxy clustering and quenching on the cosmic web in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, characterized by the combination of spherical overdensity \$$\backslash$delta\_8\$ and tidal anisotropy \$$\backslash$alpha\_5\$ centred on each galaxy. We find that the galaxy clustering is a non-monotonic function of either \$$\backslash$delta\_8\$ or \$$\backslash$alpha\_5\$, and the large-scale galaxy bias shows complex and rich behaviour on the \$$\backslash$delta\_8\$ vs. \$$\backslash$alpha\_5\$ plane. Using the mean galaxy colour as a proxy for the average quenched level of galaxies, we find that galaxy quenching is primarily a function of \$$\backslash$delta\_8\$, with some subtle yet non-trivial dependence on \$$\backslash$alpha\_5\$ at fixed \$$\backslash$delta\_8\$. The quenched galaxies generally show stronger small-scale clustering than the star-forming ones at fixed \$$\backslash$delta\_8\$ or \$$\backslash$alpha\_5\$, while the characteristic scale at which the amplitude of clustering becomes comparable for both galaxy population varies with \$$\backslash$delta\_8\$ and \$$\backslash$alpha\_5\$. Remarkably, those observed cosmic web dependences of galaxy clustering and quenching can be well reproduced by a mock galaxy catalogue constructed from the iHOD model, which places quenched and star-forming galaxies inside dark matter haloes based on the stellar-to-halo mass relation and the halo quenching model --- the \$$\backslash$delta\_8\$ and \$$\backslash$alpha\_5\$ dependences of iHOD galaxies are solely derived from the cosmic web modulation of the halo mass function. The success of the simple iHOD model suggests that any direct effect of the large-scale tidal field on galaxy formation is not currently detectable.[Abridged]},

Using these maps, we examine the global and resolved star-forming main sequences of SAMI galaxies as a function of morphology, environmental density, and stellar mass. Galaxies further below the star-forming main sequence are more likely to have flatter star formation profiles. Early-type galaxies split into two populations with similar stellar masses and central stellar mass surface densities. The main sequence population has centrally-concentrated star formation similar to late-type galaxies, while galaxies $>$3\{$\backslash$sigma\} below the main sequence show significantly reduced star formation most strikingly in the nuclear regions. The split populations support a two-step quenching mechanism, wherein halo mass first cuts off the gas supply and remaining gas continues to form stars until the local stellar mass surface density can stabilize the reduced remaining fuel against further star formation. Across all morphologies, galaxies in denser environments show a decreased specific star formation rate from the outside in, supporting an environmental cause for quenching, such as ram-pressure stripping or galaxy interactions.},

  abstract = {We study the theoretical systematics and optimize the methodology in Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) detections using the angular correlation function with tomographic bins. We calibrate and optimize the pipeline for the Dark Energy Survey Year 1 dataset using 1800 mocks. We compare the BAO fitting results obtained with three estimators: the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE), Profile Likelihood, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo. The MLE method yields the least bias in the fit results (bias/spread \$$\backslash$sim 0.02\$) and the error bar derived is the closest to the Gaussian results (1\% from 68\% Gaussian expectation). When there is mismatch between the template and the data either due to incorrect fiducial cosmology or photo-\$z\$ error, the MLE again gives the least-biased results. The BAO angular shift that is estimated based on the sound horizon and the angular diameter distance agree with the numerical fit. Various analysis choices are further tested: the number of redshift bins, cross-correlations, and angular binning. We propose two methods to correct the mock covariance when the final sample properties are slightly different from those used to create the mock. We show that the sample changes can be accommodated with the help of the Gaussian covariance matrix or more effectively using the eigenmode expansion of the mock covariance. The eigenmode expansion is significantly less susceptible to statistical fluctuations relative to the direct measurements of the covariance matrix because the number of free parameters is substantially reduced [\$p\$ parameters versus \$p(p+1)/2\$ from direct measurement].},

  title = {The Dependence of Galaxy Clustering on Tidal Environment in the {{Sloan Digital Sky Survey}}},
  abstract = {The influence of the Cosmic Web on galaxy formation and evolution is of great observational and theoretical interest. We investigate whether the Cosmic Web leaves an imprint in the spatial clustering of galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), using the group catalog of Yang et al. and tidal field estimates at \$$\backslash$sim2h\^\{-1\}\$Mpc scales from the Mass-Tides-Velocity data set of Wang et al. We use the \$$\backslash$textit\{tidal anisotropy\}\$ \$$\backslash$alpha\$ (Paranjape et al.) to characterise the tidal environment of groups, and measure the redshift-space 2-point correlation function (2pcf) of group positions and the luminosity- and colour-dependent clustering of group galaxies using samples segregated by \$$\backslash$alpha\$. We find that all the 2pcf measurements depend strongly on \$$\backslash$alpha\$, with factors of \$$\backslash$sim20\$ between the large-scale 2pcf of objects in the most and least isotropic environments. To test whether these strong trends imply ‘beyond halo mass' effects for galaxy evolution, we compare our results with corresponding 2pcf measurements in mock catalogs constructed using a halo occupation distribution that only uses halo mass as an input. We find that this prescription qualitatively reproduces \$$\backslash$textit\{all\}\$ observed trends, and also quantitatively matches many of the observed results. Although there are some statistically significant differences between our ‘halo mass only' mocks and the data -- in the most and least isotropic environments -- which deserve further investigation, our results suggest that if the tidal environment induces additional effects on galaxy properties other than those inherited from their host halos, then these must be weak.},

We select GAMA survey galaxies with \$10.25$<$\{$\backslash$rm log\}(M\_*/M\_$\backslash$odot)$<$10.75\$ and \$z$<$0.2\$ classified according to their intrinsic \$u\^*-r\^*\$ colour. From single component S$\backslash$'ersic fits, we find that the stellar mass-sensitive \$K-\$band profiles of red and green galaxy populations are very similar, while \$g-\$band profiles indicate more disk-like morphologies for the green galaxies: apparent (optical) morphological differences arise primarily from radial mass-to-light ratio variations. Two-component fits show that most green galaxies have significant bulge and disk components and that the blue to red evolution is driven by colour change in the disk. Together, these strongly suggest that galaxies evolve from blue to red through secular disk fading and that a strong bulge is present prior to any decline in star formation. The relative abundance of the green population implies a typical timescale for traversing the green valley \$$\backslash$sim 1-2\$\textasciitilde{}Gyr and is independent of environment, unlike that of the red and blue populations. While environment likely plays a r$\backslash$\^ole in triggering the passage across the green valley, it appears to have little effect on time taken. These results are consistent with a green valley population dominated by (early type) disk galaxies that are insufficiently supplied with gas to maintain previous levels of disk star formation, eventually attaining passive colours.

  shorttitle = {{{SDSS IV MaNGA}}},
  abstract = {Galaxy integrated H\{$\backslash$alpha\} star formation rate-stellar mass relation, or SFR(global)-M*(global) relation, is crucial for understanding star formation history and evolution of galaxies. However, many studies have dealt with SFR using unresolved measurements, which makes it difficult to separate out the contamination from other ionizing sources, such as active galactic nuclei and evolved stars. Using the integral field spectroscopic observations from SDSS-IV MaNGA, we spatially disentangle the contribution from different H\{$\backslash$alpha\} powering sources for \textasciitilde{}1000 galaxies. We find that, when including regions dominated by all ionizing sources in galaxies, the spatially-resolved relation between H\{$\backslash$alpha\} surface density (\{$\backslash$Sigma\}H\{$\backslash$alpha\}(all)) and stellar mass surface density (\{$\backslash$Sigma\}*(all)) progressively turns over at high \{$\backslash$Sigma\}*(all) end for increasing M*(global) and bulge dominance (bulge-to-total light ratio, B/T). This in turn leads to the flattening of the integrated H\{$\backslash$alpha\}(global)-M*(global) relation in the literature. By contrast, there is no noticeable flattening in both integrated H\{$\backslash$alpha\}(HII)-M*(HII) and spatially-resolved \{$\backslash$Sigma\}H\{$\backslash$alpha\}(HII)-\{$\backslash$Sigma\}*(HII) relations when only regions where star formation dominates the ionization are considered. In other words, the flattening can be attributed to the increasing regions powered by non-star-formation sources, which generally have lower ionizing ability than star formation. Analysis of the fractional contribution of non-star-formation sources to total H\{$\backslash$alpha\} luminosity of a galaxy suggests a decreasing role of star formation as an ionizing source toward high-mass, high-B/T galaxies and bulge regions. This result indicates that the appearance of the galaxy integrated SFR-M* relation critically depends on their global properties (M*(global) and B/T) and relative abundances of various ionizing sources within the galaxies.},

from z = 4.0 to z = 1.3 measured from a sample constructed from the deep
near-infrared Multi-wavelength Survey by Yale-Chile, the Faint Infrared
Extragalactic Survey, and the Great Observatories Origins Deep
Survey-Chandra Deep Field South surveys, all having very high-quality
optical to mid-infrared data. This sample, unique in that it combines
data from surveys with a large range of depths and areas in a
self-consistent way, allowed us to (1) minimize the uncertainty due to
cosmic variance and empirically quantify its contribution to the total
error budget; (2) simultaneously probe the high-mass end and the
low-mass end (down to \textasciitilde{}0.05 times the characteristic stellar mass) of
the SMF with good statistics; and (3) empirically derive the
redshift-dependent completeness limits in stellar mass. We provide, for
the first time, a comprehensive analysis of random and systematic
uncertainties affecting the derived SMFs, including the effect of
metallicity, extinction law, stellar population synthesis model, and
initial mass function. We find that the mass density evolves by a factor
of \textasciitilde{}17+7 -10 since z = 4.0, mostly driven by a
change in the normalization $\Phi$sstarf. If only random
errors are taken into account, we find evidence for mass-dependent
evolution, with the low-mass end evolving more rapidly than the
high-mass end. However, we show that this result is no longer robust
when systematic uncertainties due to the SED-modeling assumptions are
taken into account. Another significant uncertainty is the contribution
to the overall stellar mass density of galaxies below our mass limit;
future studies with WFC3 will provide better constraints on the SMF at
masses below 1010 M sun at z$>$2. Taking our
results at face value, we find that they are in conflict with
semianalytic models of galaxy formation. The models predict SMFs that
are in general too steep, with too many low-mass galaxies and too few
high-mass galaxies. The discrepancy at the high-mass end is susceptible
to uncertainties in the models and the data, but the discrepancy at the
low-mass end may be more difficult to explain.

  abstract = {We study the effects of galaxy environment on the evolution of the stellar-mass function (SMF) over 0.2 $<$ z $<$ 2.0 using the FourStar Galaxy Evolution (ZFOURGE) survey and NEWFIRM Medium-Band Survey (NMBS) down to the stellar-mass completeness limit, log M / Msun $>$ 9.0 (9.5) at z = 1.0 (2.0). We compare the SMFs for quiescent and star-forming galaxies in the highest and lowest environments using a density estimator based on the distance to the galaxies' third-nearest neighbors. For star-forming galaxies, at all redshifts there are only minor differences with environment in the shape of the SMF. For quiescent galaxies, the SMF in the lowest densities shows no evolution with redshift, other than an overall increase in number density (phi*) with time. This suggests that the stellar-mass dependence of quenching in relatively isolated galaxies is both universal and does not evolve strongly. While at z $>$\textasciitilde{} 1.5 the SMF of quiescent galaxies is indistinguishable in the highest and lowest densities, at lower redshifts it shows a rapidly increasing number density of lower-mass galaxies, log M / Msun \textasciitilde{}= 9-10. We argue this evolution can account for all the redshift evolution in the shape of the total quiescent-galaxy SMF. This evolution in the quiescent-galaxy SMF at higher redshift (z $>$ 1) requires an environmental-quenching efficiency that decreases with decreasing stellar mass at 0.5 $<$ z $<$ 1.5 or it would overproduce the number of lower-mass quiescent galaxies in denser environments. This requires a dominant environment process such as starvation combined with rapid gas depletion and ejection at z $>$ 0.5 - 1.0 for galaxies in our mass range. The efficiency of this process decreases with redshift allowing other processes (such as galaxy interactions and ram-pressure stripping) to become more important at later times, z $<$ 0.5.},

Focussing on Fourier-space statistics, we present a new analysis of the effect of the survey window function, and the variation of the line-of-sight across a survey, on the modelling of power spectrum multipoles. We determine the joint covariance of the Fourier-space multipoles in a Gaussian approximation, and indicate how these techniques may be extended to studies of overlapping galaxy populations via multipole cross-power spectra. We apply our methodology to one of the widest-area galaxy redshift surveys currently available, the 6-degree Field Galaxy Survey, deducing a normalized growth rate f*sigma\_8 = 0.38 +/- 0.12 in the low-redshift Universe, in agreement with previous analyses of this dataset using different techniques. Our framework should be useful for processing future wide-angle galaxy redshift surveys.},

  abstract = {To gain understanding of the complicated, non-linear and numerical processes associated with the tidal evolution of dark matter subhaloes in numerical simulation, we perform a large suite of idealized simulations that follow individual N-body subhaloes in a fixed, analytical host halo potential. By varying both physical and numerical parameters, we investigate under what conditions the subhaloes undergo disruption. We confirm the conclusions from our more analytical assessment in van den Bosch et al. that most disruption is numerical in origin; as long as a subhalo is resolved with sufficient mass and force resolution, a bound remnant survives. This implies that state-of-the-art cosmological simulations still suffer from significant overmerging. We demonstrate that this is mainly due to inadequate force-softening, which causes excessive mass loss and artificial tidal disruption. In addition, we show that subhaloes in N-body simulations are susceptible to a runaway instability triggered by the amplification of discreteness noise in the presence of a tidal field. These two processes conspire to put serious limitations on the reliability of dark matter substructure in state-of-the-art cosmological simulations. We present two criteria that can be used to assess whether individual subhaloes in cosmological simulations are reliable or not, and advocate that subhaloes that satisfy either of these two criteria be discarded from further analysis. We discuss the potential implications of this work for several areas in astrophysics.},

high density environments based on fixed cylindrical aperture

environments, we examine the evolution of their stellar mass function
(SMF). Then using the SMFs we compute
\{\{f\}Q\}(\{\{M\}*\}) and quantify its evolution within
our redshift range. We find that the quiescent fraction is higher at
higher masses and in denser environments. The quiescent fraction rises
with cosmic time for all masses and environments. At a fiducial mass of

the quiescent fraction rises by 15\% at the lowest environments and by

  abstract = {Local galaxies are broadly divided into two main classes, star-forming (gas-rich) and quiescent (passive and gas-poor). The primary mechanism responsible for quenching star formation in galaxies and transforming them into quiescent and passive systems is still unclear. Sudden removal of gas through outflows or stripping is one of the mechanisms often proposed. An alternative mechanism is so-called "strangulation", in which the supply of cold gas to the galaxy is halted. Here we report that the difference between quiescent and star forming galaxies in terms of stellar metallicity (i.e. the fraction of metals heavier than helium in stellar atmospheres) can be used to discriminate efficiently between the two mechanisms. The analysis of the stellar metallicity in local galaxies, from 26,000 spectra, clearly reveals that strangulation is the primary mechanism responsible for quenching star formation, with a typical timescale of 4 billion years, at least for local galaxies with a stellar mass less than 10\^11 solar masses. This result is further supported independently by the stellar age difference between quiescent and star-forming galaxies, which indicates that quiescent galaxies of less than 10\^11 solar masses are on average observed four billion years after quenching due to strangulation.},

densities in fixed apertures to characterize the environment of galaxies
brighter than \{\{JH\}\}140$<$ 24 mag in the redshift range
0.5$<$ z$<$ 3.0. By linking observed galaxies to a mock sample,
selected to reproduce the 3D-HST sample selection and redshift accuracy,
each 3D-HST galaxy is assigned a probability density function of the
host halo mass, and a probability that it is a central or a satellite
galaxy. The same procedure is applied to a z = 0 sample selected from
Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We compute the fraction of passive central and
satellite galaxies as a function of stellar and halo mass, and redshift,
and then derive the fraction of galaxies that were quenched by
environment specific processes. Using the mock sample, we estimate that
the timescale for satellite quenching is \{t\}\{quench\}\texttildelow{}
2\{--\}5 \{Gyr\}; it is longer at lower stellar mass or lower redshift, but
remarkably independent of halo mass. This indicates that, in the range
of environments commonly found within the 3D-HST sample
(\{M\}h$\lessequivlnt$ \{10\}14 \{M\}$\odot$ ),
satellites are quenched by exhaustion of their gas reservoir in the
absence of cosmological accretion. We find that the quenching times can
be separated into a delay phase, during which satellite galaxies behave
similarly to centrals at fixed stellar mass, and a phase where the star
formation rate drops rapidly (\{$\tau$ \}f\texttildelow{} 0.4\{--\}0.6 Gyr),
as shown previously at z = 0. We conclude that this scenario requires
satellite galaxies to retain a large reservoir of multi-phase gas upon
accretion, even at high redshift, and that this gas sustains star
formation for the long quenching times observed.},

f\{\_N\_L\^local\}, in the primordial density field, paying particular
attention to the impact of systematic uncertainties. The BOSS galaxy
density field is systematically affected by the local stellar density
and this influences the ability to accurately measure f\{\_N\_L\^local\}. In
the absence of any correction, we find (erroneously) that the
probability that f\{\_N\_L\^local\} is greater than zero, P(f\{\_N\_L\^local\}
$>$ 0), is 99.5 per cent. After quantifying and correcting for the
systematic bias and including the added uncertainty, we find - 45 $<$
f\{\_N\_L\^local\} $<$ 195 at 95 per cent confidence and P(f\{\_N\_L\^local\}
$>$ 0) = 91.0 per cent. A more conservative approach assumes that we
have only learnt the k dependence of the systematic bias and allows any
amplitude for the systematic correction; we find that the systematic

determine that -82 $<$ f\{\_N\_L\^local\} $<$ 178 (at 95 per cent

demonstrates the importance of accounting for the impact of Galactic

To minimize the impact of stellar contamination in our luminous red galaxy (LRG) sample, we use the recent Baryon Oscillations Spectroscopic Survey catalog of Ross et al. (2011). We also find evidence for a new systematic in the NVSS radio galaxy survey similar to, but smaller than, the known declination-dependent issue; this is difficult to remove without affecting the inferred PNG signal, and thus we do not include the NVSS auto-correlation function in our analyses.

Here we first rederive this result within the context of peak-background split formalism and show that it only depends on the assumption of universality of mass function, assuming halo bias only depends on mass. We then use extended Press-Schechter formalism to argue that this assumption may be violated and the scale dependent bias will depend on other properties, such as merging history of halos. In particular, in the limit of recent mergers we find the effect is suppressed. Next we use these predictions in conjunction with a compendium of large scale data to put a limit on the value of f\_NL. When combining all data assuming that halo occupation depends only on halo mass, we get a limit of -29 \textasciitilde{} (-65)$<$ f\_NL $<$ +70 \textasciitilde{}(+93) at 95\% (99.7\%) confidence. While we use a wide range of datasets, our combined result is dominated by the signal from the SDSS photometric quasar sample. If the latter are modeled as recent mergers then the limits weaken to -31 \textasciitilde{}(-96) $<$ f\_NL $<$ +70 \textasciitilde{} (+96) . These limits are comparable to the strongest current limits from the WMAP 5 year analysis, with no evidence of a positive signal in f\_NL. While the method needs to be thoroughly tested against large scale structure simulations with realistic quasar and galaxy formation models, our results indicate that this is a competitive method relative to CMB and should be further pursued both observationally and theoretically.},

  abstract = {We study the constraining power on primordial non-Gaussianity of future surveys of the large-scale structure of the Universe for both near-term surveys (such as the Dark Energy Survey - DES) as well as longer term projects such as Euclid and WFIRST. Specifically we perform a Fisher matrix analysis forecast for such surveys, using DES-like and Euclid-like configurations as examples, and take account of any expected photometric and spectroscopic data. We focus on two-point statistics and we consider three observables: the 3D galaxy power spectrum in redshift space, the angular galaxy power spectrum, and the projected weak-lensing shear power spectrum. We study the effects of adding a few extra parameters to the basic LCDM set. We include the two standard parameters to model the current value for the dark energy equation of state and its time derivative, w\_0, w\_a, and we account for the possibility of primordial non-Gaussianity of the local, equilateral and orthogonal types, of parameter fNL and, optionally, of spectral index n\_fNL. We present forecasted constraints on these parameters using the different observational probes. We show that accounting for models that include primordial non-Gaussianity does not degrade the constraint on the standard LCDM set nor on the dark-energy equation of state. By combining the weak lensing data and the information on projected galaxy clustering, consistently including all two-point functions and their covariance, we find forecasted marginalised errors sigma (fNL) \textasciitilde{} 3, sigma (n\_fNL) \textasciitilde{} 0.12 from a Euclid-like survey for the local shape of primordial non-Gaussianity, while the orthogonal and equilateral constraints are weakened for the galaxy clustering case, due to the weaker scale-dependence of the bias. In the lensing case, the constraints remain instead similar in all configurations.},

  doi = {10.1093/mnras/stv2513},
  abstract = {The galaxy stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) is nearly 
time-independent for z $<$ 4. We therefore construct a time-independent SHMR model for central galaxies, wherein the in situ star formation rate (SFR) is determined by the halo mass accretion rate (MAR), which we call stellar halo accretion rate coevolution (SHARC). We show that the \texttildelow{}0.3 dex dispersion of the halo MAR matches the observed
dispersion of the SFR on the star formation main sequence (MS). In the context of ‘bathtub'-type models of galaxy formation, SHARC leads to mass-dependent constraints on the relation between SFR and MAR. Despite its simplicity and the simplified treatment of mass growth from mergers, the SHARC model is likely to be a good approximation for central galaxies with M* = 109-1010.5
M$\odot$ that are on the MS, representing most of the star
formation in the Universe. SHARC predictions agree with observed SFRs for galaxies on the MS at low redshifts, agree fairly well at z \texttildelow{} 4, but exceed observations at z $\greaterequivlnt$ 4. Assuming that the interstellar gas mass is constant for each galaxy (the ‘equilibrium condition' in bathtub models), the SHARC model allows calculation of net mass loading factors for inflowing and outflowing gas. With assumptions about preventive feedback based on simulations, SHARC allows calculation of galaxy metallicity evolution. If galaxy SFRs indeed track halo MARs, especially at low redshifts, that may help explain the success of models linking galaxy properties to haloes (including age-matching) and the similarities between two-halo galaxy conformity and halo mass accretion conformity.},

the evolution of the star-forming galaxy (SFG) main sequence (MS) in

converting all observations to a common set of calibrations, we find a
remarkable consensus among MS observations (\textasciitilde{}0.1 dex 1$\sigma$

bins of constant mass, we deconvolve the observed scatter about the MS
within each observed redshift bin. After accounting for observed scatter
between different SFR indicators, we find the width of the MS
distribution is \textasciitilde{}0.2 dex and remains constant over cosmic time. Our best
fits indicate the slope of the MS is likely time-dependent, with our
best-fit log SFR(M *, t) = (0.84 $\pm$ 0.02 - 0.026

that (1) the most accurate representations of MS SFHs are given by
delayed-$\tau$ models, (2) the decline in fractional stellar mass growth
for a "typical" MS galaxy today is approximately linear for most of its
lifetime, and (3) scatter about the MS can be generated by galaxies
evolving along identical evolutionary tracks assuming an initial

  abstract = {Aims: The goal of this work is to infer the star formation properties and the mass assembly process of high redshift (0.3 $\leq$ z $<$ 2.5)
galaxies from their IR emission using the 24 $\mu$m band of MIPS-Spitzer. Methods: We used an updated version of the GOODS-MUSIC catalog, which has multiwavelength coverage from 0.3 to 24 $\mu$m and either
spectroscopic or accurate photometric redshifts. We describe how the catalog has been extended by the addition of mid-IR fluxes derived from the MIPS 24 $\mu$m image. We compared two different estimators of the star formation rate (SFR hereafter). One is the total infrared emission derived from 24 $\mu$m, estimated using both synthetic and empirical IR templates. The other one is a multiwavelength fit to the full galaxy SED, which automatically accounts for dust reddening and age-star formation activity degeneracies. For both estimates, we computed the SFR density and the specific SFR. Results: We show that the two SFR indicators are roughly consistent, once the uncertainties involved are taken into account. However, they show a systematic trend, IR-based estimates exceeding the fit-based ones as the star formation rate increases. With this new catalog, we show that: a) at z$>$0.3, the star formation rate is correlated well with stellar mass, and this
relationship seems to steepen with redshift if one relies on IR-based estimates of the SFR; b) the contribution to the global SFRD by massive galaxies increases with redshift up to $\simeq$ 2.5, more rapidly than for galaxies of lower mass, but appears to flatten at higher z; c) despite this increase, the most important contributors to the SFRD at any z are galaxies of about, or immediately lower than, the characteristic stellar mass; d) at z$\simeq$ 2, massive galaxies are actively star-forming, with a median \{SFR\} $\simeq$ 300 M\_$\odot$ yr-1. During this epoch,
our targeted galaxies assemble a substantial part of their final stellar mass; e) the specific SFR (SSFR) shows a clear bimodal distribution. Conclusions: The analysis of the SFR density and the SSFR seems to support the downsizing scenario, according to which high mass galaxies have formed their stars earlier and more rapidly than their low mass counterparts. A comparison with renditions of theoretical simulations of galaxy formation and evolution indicates that these models follow the global increase in the SSFR with redshift and predict the existence of quiescent galaxies even at z$>$1.5. However, the average SSFR is
systematically underpredicted by all models considered.

  abstract = {Galaxy mergers are believed to play a key role in transforming star-forming disc galaxies into quenched ellipticals. Most of our theoretical knowledge about such morphological transformations does, however, rely on idealized simulations where processes such as cooling of hot halo gas into the disc and gas accretion in the post-merger phase are not treated in a self-consistent cosmological fashion. In this paper, we study the morphological evolution of the stellar components of four major mergers occurring at z = 0.5 in cosmological hydrodynamical zoom simulations. In all simulations, the merger reduces the disc mass fraction, but all galaxies simulated at our highest resolution regrow a significant disc by z = 0 (with a disc fraction larger than 24 per cent). For runs with our default physics model, which includes galactic winds from star formation and black hole feedback, none of the merger remnants are quenched, but in a set of simulations with stronger black hole feedback, we find that major mergers can indeed quench galaxies. We conclude that major merger remnants commonly evolve into star-forming disc galaxies, unless sufficiently strong active galactic nucleus feedback assists in the quenching of the remnant.},

  doi = {10.1051/0004-6361/201527129},
  abstract = {We exploit the first public data release of VIPERS to investigate environmental effects in the evolution of galaxies between z \textasciitilde{} 0.5 and 0.9. The large number of spectroscopic redshifts (more than 50 000) over an area of about 10 deg\textsuperscript{2} provides a galaxy sample with high statistical power. The accurate redshift measurements ($\sigma$\textsubscript{z} = 0.00047(1 + z\textsubscript{spec})) allow us to robustly isolate galaxies living in the lowest and highest density environments ($\delta{}<$ 0.7 and $\delta{}>$ 4, respectively) as defined in terms of spatial 3D density contrast $\delta$. We estimate the stellar mass function of galaxies residing in these two environments and constrain the high-mass end ($\mathscr{M}$ $\greaterequivlnt$ 10\textsuperscript{11} $\mathscr{M}$\textsubscript{$\Sun$}) with unprecedented precision. We find that the galaxy stellar mass function in the densest regions has a different shape than was measured at low densities, with an enhancement of massive galaxies and a hint of a flatter (less negative) slope at z$<$ 0.8. We normalise each mass function to the comoving volume occupied by the corresponding environment and relate estimates from different redshift bins. We observe an evolution of the stellar mass function of VIPERS galaxies in high densities, while the low-density one is nearly constant. We compare these results to semi-analytical models and find consistent environmental signatures in the simulated stellar mass functions. We discuss how the halo mass function and fraction of central/satellite galaxies depend on the environments considered, making intrinsic and environmental properties of galaxies physically coupled, hence difficult to disentangle. The evolution of our low-density regions is described well by the formalism introduced by Peng et al. (2010, ApJ, 721, 193), and is consistent with the idea that galaxies become progressively passive because of internal physical processes. The same formalism could also describe the evolution of the mass function in the high density regions, but only if a significant contribution from dry mergers is considered.

The comic web extraction relies on the density field Hessian matrix and breaks the density field into clusters, filaments, and the field. We provide the density field and cosmic web measures to the community. We show that at z $\lessequivlnt$ 0.8, the median star formation rate (SFR) in the cosmic web gradually declines from the field to clusters and this decline is especially sharp for satellites (\~1 dex versus \~0.5 dex for centrals). However, at z $\greaterequivlnt$ 0.8, the trend flattens out for the overall galaxy population and satellites. For star-forming (SF) galaxies only, the median SFR is constant at z $\greaterequivlnt$ 0.5 but declines by \~0.3-0.4 dex from the field to clusters for satellites and centrals at z $\lessequivlnt$ 0.5. We argue that for satellites, the main role of the cosmic web environment is to control their SF fraction, whereas for centrals, it is mainly to control their overall SFR at z $\lessequivlnt$ 0.5 and to set their fraction at z $\greaterequivlnt$ 0.5. We suggest that most satellites experience a rapid quenching mechanism as they fall from the field into clusters through filaments, whereas centrals mostly undergo a slow environmental quenching at z $\lessequivlnt$ 0.5 and a fast mechanism at higher redshifts. Our preliminary results highlight the importance of the large-scale cosmic web on galaxy evolution.},

  abstract = {Gladders et al. have recently suggested that the star formation histories (SFHs) of individual galaxies are characterized by a log-normal function in time, implying a slow decline rather than rapid quenching. We test their conjecture on theoretical SFHs from the cosmological simulation Illustris and on observationally inferred SFHs. While the log-normal form necessarily ignores short-lived features such as starbursts, it fits the overall shape of the majority of SFHs very well. In particular, 85\% of the cumulative SFHs are fitted to within a maximum error of 5\% of the total stellar mass formed, and 99\% to within 10\%. The log-normal performs systematically better than the commonly used delayed-tau model, and is superseded only by functions with more than three free parameters. Poor fits are mostly found in galaxies that were rapidly quenched after becoming satellites. We explore the log-normal parameter space of normalization, peak time, and full width at half maximum, and find that the simulated and observed samples occupy similar regions, though Illustris predicts wider, later-forming SFHs on average. The ensemble of log-normal fits correctly reproduces complex metrics such as the evolution of Illustris galaxies across the star formation main sequence, but overpredicts their quenching timescales. SFHs in Illustris are a diverse population not determined by any one physical property of galaxies, but follow a tight relation, where \$$\backslash$mathrm\{width\}$\backslash$propto$\backslash$mathrm\{(peak$\backslash$ time)\}\^\{3/2\}\$. We show that such a relation can be explained qualitatively (though not quantitatively) by a close connection between the growth of dark matter halos and their galaxies.},

  volume = {465},
  doi = {10.1093/mnras/stw2884},
  abstract = {We use the hydrodynamical EAGLE simulation to study the magnitude and origin of the scatter in the stellar mass-halo mass relation for central galaxies. We separate cause and effect by correlating stellar masses in the baryonic simulation with halo properties in a matched dark matter only (DMO) simulation. The scatter in stellar mass increases with redshift and decreases with halo mass. At z = 0.1, it declines from 0.25 dex at M\textsubscript{200, DMO} $\approx$ 10\textsuperscript{11} M\textsubscript{$\Sun$} to 0.12 dex at M\textsubscript{200, DMO} $\approx$ 10\textsuperscript{13} M\textsubscript{$\Sun$}, but the trend is weak above 10\textsuperscript{12} M\textsubscript{$\Sun$}. For M\textsubscript{200, DMO} $<$ 10\textsuperscript{12.5} M\textsubscript{$\Sun$} up to 0.04 dex of the scatter is due to scatter in the halo concentration. At fixed halo mass, a larger stellar mass corresponds to a more concentrated halo. This is likely because higher concentrations imply earlier formation times and hence more time for accretion and star formation, and/or because feedback is less efficient in haloes with higher binding energies. The maximum circular velocity, V\textsubscript{max, DMO}, and binding energy are therefore more fundamental properties than halo mass, meaning that they are more accurate predictors of stellar mass, and we provide fitting formulae for their relations with stellar mass. However, concentration alone cannot explain the total scatter in the M\_star - M\_\{200, DMO\} relation, and it does not explain the scatter in M\textsubscript{star}-V\textsubscript{max, DMO}. Halo spin, sphericity, triaxiality, substructure and environment are also not responsible for the remaining scatter, which thus could be due to more complex halo properties or non-linear/stochastic baryonic effects.},

In this work, we present a novel approach for parameterizing the degree of concentration dependence in the abundance matching method. This new parameterization provides a smooth interpolation between two commonly used matching proxies: the peak halo mass and the peak halo maximal circular velocity. This parameterization controls the amount of dependence of galaxy luminosity on halo concentration at a fixed halo mass. Effectively this interpolation scheme enables abundance matching models to have adjustable assembly bias in the resulting galaxy catalogs. With the new 400 \{Mpc\} \{h\}\textsuperscript{-1} DarkSky Simulation, whose larger volume provides lower sample variance, we further show that low-redshift two-point clustering and satellite fraction measurements from SDSS can already provide a joint constraint on this concentration dependence and the scatter within the abundance matching framework.},

  abstract = {We study the dependence of the galaxy content of dark matter halos on large-scale environment and halo formation time using semi-analytic galaxy models applied to the Millennium simulation. We analyze subsamples of halos at the extremes of these distributions and measure the occupation functions for the galaxies they host. We find distinct differences among these occupation functions. The main effect with environment is that central galaxies (and in one model, also the satellites) in denser regions start populating lower-mass halos. A similar, but significantly stronger, trend exists with halo age, where early-forming halos are more likely to host central galaxies at lower halo mass. We discuss the origin of these trends and the connection to the stellar mass-halo mass relation. We find that, at fixed halo mass, older halos and to some extent also halos in dense environments tend to host more massive galaxies. Additionally, we see a reverse trend for the occupation of satellite galaxies where early-forming halos have fewer satellites, likely due to having more time for them to merge with the central galaxy. We describe these occupancy variations in terms of the changes in the occupation function parameters, which can aid in constructing realistic mock galaxy samples. Finally, we study the corresponding galaxy auto- and cross-correlation functions of the different samples and elucidate the impact of assembly bias on galaxy clustering. Our results can inform theoretical modeling of galaxy assembly bias and attempts to detect it in the real universe.},

  volume = {472},
  doi = {10.1093/mnras/stx2155},
  abstract = {It has long been known that environment has a large effect on star formation in galaxies. There are several known plausible mechanisms to remove the cool gas needed for star formation, such as strangulation, harassment and ram-pressure stripping. It is unclear which process is dominant, and over what range of stellar mass. In this paper, we find evidence for suppression of the cross-correlation function between massive galaxies and less massive star-forming galaxies, giving a measure of how less likely a galaxy is to be star forming in the vicinity of a more massive galaxy. We develop a formalism for modelling environmental quenching mechanisms within the halo occupation distribution scheme. We find that at z $\sim$ 2 environment is not a significant factor in determining quenching of star-forming galaxies, and that galaxies are quenched with similar probabilities when they are satellites in sub-group environments, as they are globally. However, by z $\sim$ 0.5 galaxies are much less likely to be star forming when in a high-density (group or low-mass cluster) environment than when not. This increased probability of being quenched does not appear to have significant radial dependence within the halo at lower redshifts, supportive of the quenching being caused by the halting of fresh inflows of pristine gas, as opposed to by tidal stripping. Furthermore, by separating the massive sample into passive and star forming, we see that this effect is further enhanced when the central galaxy is passive, a manifestation of galactic conformity.},

  doi = {10.1093/mnras/stx2045},
  abstract = {Dark matter halo clustering depends not only on halo mass, but also on other properties such as concentration and shape. This phenomenon is known broadly as assembly bias. We explore the dependence of assembly bias on halo definition, parametrized by spherical overdensity parameter, $\increment$. We summarize the strength of concentration-, shape-, and spin-dependent halo clustering as a function of halo mass and halo definition. Concentration-dependent clustering depends strongly on mass at all $\increment$. For conventional halo definitions ($\increment$ $\sim$ 200 - 600 m), concentration-dependent clustering at low mass is driven by a population of haloes that is altered through interactions with neighbouring haloes. Concentration-dependent clustering can be greatly reduced through a mass-dependent halo definition with $\increment$ $\sim$ 20 - 40 m for haloes with M\textsubscript{200 m} $\lessequivlnt$ 10\textsuperscript{12} h\textsuperscript{-1}M\textsubscript{$\Sun$}. Smaller $\increment$ implies larger radii and mitigates assembly bias at low mass by subsuming altered, so-called backsplash haloes into now larger host haloes. At higher masses (M\textsubscript{200 m} $\greaterequivlnt$ 10\textsuperscript{13} h\textsuperscript{-1}M\textsubscript{$\Sun$}) larger overdensities, $\increment$ $\greaterequivlnt$ 600 m, are necessary. Shape- and spin-dependent clustering are significant for all halo definitions that we explore and exhibit a relatively weaker mass dependence. Generally, both the strength and the sense of assembly bias depend on halo definition, varying significantly even among common definitions. We identify no halo definition that mitigates all manifestations of assembly bias. A halo definition that mitigates assembly bias based on one halo property (e.g. concentration) must be mass dependent. The halo definitions that best mitigate concentration-dependent halo clustering do not coincide with the expected average splashback radii at fixed halo mass.},

  abstract = {Determining the positions of halo centres in large-scale structure surveys is crucial for many cosmological studies. A common assumption is that halo centres correspond to the location of their brightest member galaxies. In this paper, we study the dynamics of brightest galaxies with respect to other halo members in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR7. Specifically, we look at the line-of-sight velocity and spatial offsets between brightest galaxies and their neighbours. We compare those to detailed mock catalogues, constructed from high-resolution, dark-matter-only N-body simulations, in which it is assumed that satellite galaxies trace dark matter subhaloes. This allows us to place constraints on the fraction f\textsubscript{BNC} of haloes in which the brightest galaxy is not the central. Compared to previous studies, we explicitly take into account the unrelaxed state of the host haloes, velocity offsets of halo cores and correlations between f\textsubscript{BNC} and the satellite occupation. We find that f\textsubscript{BNC} strongly decreases with the luminosity of the brightest galaxy and increases with the mass of the host halo. Overall, in the halo mass range 10\textsuperscript{13}-10\textsuperscript{14.5} h\textsuperscript{- 1}M\textsubscript{$\Sun$} we find f\textsubscript{BNC} $\sim$ 30 per cent, in good agreement with a previous study by Skibba et al.

  abstract = {We investigate galaxy conformity using the MUFASA cosmological hydrodynamical simulation. We show a bimodal distribution in galaxy colour with radius, albeit with too many low-mass quenched satellite galaxies compared to observations. MUFASA produces conformity in observed properties such as colour, specific star formation rate (sSFR), and H I content, i.e. neighbouring galaxies have similar properties. We see analogous trends in other properties such as in environment, stellar age, H\textsubscript{2} content, and metallicity. We introduce quantifying conformity using S(R), measuring the relative difference in upper and lower quartile properties of the neighbours. We show that low-mass and non-quenched haloes have weak conformity (S(R)$\lessequivlnt$ 0.5) extending to large projected radii R in all properties, while high-mass and quenched haloes have strong conformity (S(R)\~ 1) that diminishes rapidly with R and disappears at R $\greaterequivlnt$ 1 Mpc. S(R) is strongest for environment in low-mass haloes, and sSFR (or colour) in high-mass haloes, and is dominated by one-halo conformity with the exception of H I in small haloes. Metallicity shows a curious anticonformity in massive haloes. Tracking the evolution of conformity for z = 0 galaxies back in time shows that conformity broadly emerges as a late-time (z $\lessequivlnt$ 1) phenomenon. However, for fixed halo mass bins, conformity is fairly constant with redshift out to z $\greaterequivlnt$ 2. These trends are consistent with the idea that strong conformity only emerges once haloes grow above MUFASA's quenching mass scale of \~10\textsuperscript{12} M\textsubscript{$\Sun$}. A quantitative measure of conformity in various properties, along with its evolution, thus represents a new and stringent test of the impact of quenching on environment within current galaxy formation models.},

  doi = {10.1051/0004-6361/201730587},
  abstract = {Context. Current constraints on models of galaxy evolution rely on morphometric catalogs extracted from multi-band photometric surveys. However, these catalogs are altered by selection effects that are difficult to model, that correlate in non trivial ways, and that can lead to contradictory predictions if not taken into account carefully. \\
 Aims: To address this issue, we have developed a new approach combining parametric Bayesian indirect likelihood (pBIL) techniques and empirical modeling with realistic image simulations that reproduce a large fraction of these selection effects. This allows us to perform a direct comparison between observed and simulated images and to infer robust constraints on model parameters. \\
 Methods: We use a semi-empirical forward model to generate a distribution of mock galaxies from a set of physical parameters. These galaxies are passed through an image simulator reproducing the instrumental characteristics of any survey and are then extracted in the same way as the observed data. The discrepancy between the simulated and observed data is quantified, and minimized with a custom sampling process based on adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. \\
 Results: Using synthetic data matching most of the properties of a Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey Deep field, we demonstrate the robustness and internal consistency of our approach by inferring the parameters governing the size and luminosity functions and their evolutions for different realistic populations of galaxies. We also compare the results of our approach with those obtained from the classical spectral energy distribution fitting and photometric redshift approach. \\
 Conclusions: Our pipeline infers efficiently the luminosity and size distribution and evolution parameters with a very limited number of observables (three photometric bands). When compared to SED fitting based on the same set of observables, our method yields results that are more accurate and free from systematic biases.},

It pursues three core programs: the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment 2 (APOGEE-2), Mapping Nearby Galaxies at APO (MaNGA), and the Extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS). As well as its core program, eBOSS contains two major subprograms: the Time Domain Spectroscopic Survey (TDSS) and the SPectroscopic IDentification of ERosita Sources (SPIDERS). This paper describes the first data release from SDSS-IV, Data Release 13 (DR13). DR13 makes publicly available the first 1390 spatially resolved integral field unit observations of nearby galaxies from MaNGA. It includes new observations from eBOSS, completing the Sloan Extended QUasar, Emission-line galaxy, Luminous red galaxy Survey (SEQUELS), which also targeted variability-selected objects and X-ray-selected objects. DR13 includes new reductions of the SDSS-III BOSS data, improving the spectrophotometric calibration and redshift classification, and new reductions of the SDSS-III APOGEE-1 data, improving stellar parameters for dwarf stars and cooler stars. DR13 provides more robust and precise photometric calibrations. Value-added target catalogs relevant for eBOSS, TDSS, and SPIDERS and an updated red-clump catalog for APOGEE are also available. This paper describes the location and format of the data and provides references to important technical papers. The SDSS web site, \href{http://www.sdss.org}{http://www.sdss.org}, provides links to the data, tutorials, examples of data access, and extensive documentation of the reduction and analysis procedures. DR13 is the first of a scheduled set that will contain new data and analyses from the planned $\sim$6 yr operations of SDSS-IV.},

  abstract = {We present measurements of the clustering of galaxies as a function of their stellar mass in the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey. We compare the clustering of samples using 12 different methods for estimating stellar mass, isolating the method that has the smallest scatter at fixed halo mass. In this test, the stellar mass estimate with the smallest errors yields the highest amplitude of clustering at fixed number density. We find that the PCA stellar masses of Chen et al. clearly have the tightest correlation with halo mass. The PCA masses use the full galaxy spectrum, differentiating them from other estimates that only use optical photometric information. Using the PCA masses, we measure the large-scale bias as a function of \{M\}\textsubscript{* } for galaxies with \{log\}\{M\}\textsubscript{* }$\geq$slant 11.4, correcting for incompleteness at the low-mass end of our measurements. Using the abundance matching ansatz to connect dark matter halo mass to stellar mass, we construct theoretical models of b(\{M\}\textsubscript{* }) that match the same stellar mass function but have different amounts of scatter in stellar mass at fixed halo mass, \{$\sigma$ \}\textsubscript{\{log\vphantom\}}M* \vphantom\{\}. Using this approach, we find \{$\sigma$ \}\textsubscript{\{log\vphantom\}}M* \vphantom\{\}=\{0.18\}\textsubscript{-0.02}\textsuperscript{+0.01}. This value includes both intrinsic scatter as well as random errors in the stellar masses. To partially remove the latter, we use repeated spectra to estimate statistical errors on the stellar masses, yielding an upper limit to the intrinsic scatter of 0.16 dex.},

We consider a sample of 147 000 quasars from the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) distributed over 2044 square degrees with redshifts 0.8 $<$ z $<$ 2.2 and measure their spherically averaged clustering in both configuration and Fourier space. Our observational data set and the 1400 simulated realizations of the data set allow us to detect a preference for BAO that is greater than 2.8$\sigma$. We determine the spherically averaged BAO distance to z = 1.52 to 3.8 per cent precision: D\textsubscript{V}(z = 1.52) = 3843 $\pm$ 147(r\textsubscript{d}/r\textsubscript{d, fid})Mpc. This is the first time the location of the BAO feature has been measured between redshifts 1 and 2. Our result is fully consistent with the prediction obtained by extrapolating the Planck flat $\Lambda$CDM best-fitting cosmology. All of our results are consistent with basic large-scale structure (LSS) theory, confirming quasars to be a reliable tracer of LSS, and provide a starting point for numerous cosmological tests to be performed with eBOSS quasar samples. We combine our result with previous, independent, BAO distance measurements to construct an updated BAO distance-ladder. Using these BAO data alone and marginalizing over the length of the standard ruler, we find $\Omega$\textsubscript{$\Lambda$} $>$ 0 at 6.6$\sigma$ significance when testing a $\Lambda$CDM model with free curvature.},

We show that the main source of systematics in the evaluation of the correlation function arises from inhomogeneities in the quasar target selection, particularly related to the extinction and depth of the imaging data used for targeting. We propose a weighting scheme that mitigates these systematics. We measure the quasar correlation function and provide the most accurate measurement to date of the quasar bias in this redshift range, b\textsubscript{Q} = 2.45 $\pm$ 0.05 at bar z=1.55, together with its evolution with redshift. We use this information to determine the minimum mass of the halo hosting the quasars and the characteristic halo mass, which we find to be both independent of redshift within statistical error. Using a recently-measured quasar-luminosity-function we also determine the quasar duty cycle. The size of this first year sample is insufficient to detect any luminosity dependence to quasar clustering and this issue should be further studied with the final \textasciitilde{}500,000 eBOSS quasar sample.},

At redshift z = 0, the simulations cover four orders of magnitude in halo mass from \~10\textsuperscript{11}M\textsubscript{$\Sun$} with 8783 874 distinct haloes and 532 533 subhaloes. The total volume used is \~515 Gpc\textsuperscript{3}, more than eight times larger than in previous studies. We measure and model the halo mass function, its covariance matrix w.r.t halo mass and the large-scale halo bias. With the formalism of the excursion-set mass function, we explicit the tight interconnection between the covariance matrix, bias and halo mass function. We obtain a very accurate ($<$2 per cent level) model of the distinct halo mass function. We also model the subhalo mass function and its relation to the distinct halo mass function. The set of models obtained provides a complete and precise framework for the description of haloes in the concordance Planck cosmology. Finally, we provide precise analytical fits of the V\textsubscript{max} maximum velocity function up to redshift z $<$ 2.3 to push for the development of halo occupation distribution using V\textsubscript{max}.

The halo catalogue covers the full sky, extending to z = 2.2 with a mass resolution of \~10\textsuperscript{11} h\textsuperscript{-1} M\textsubscript{$\Sun$}. We use this to build a galaxy catalogue, which has an r-band magnitude limit of r $<$ 20.0, with a median redshift of z \~ 0.2. A Monte Carlo HOD method is used to assign galaxies to the halo lightcone catalogue, and we evolve the HODs to reproduce a target luminosity function; by construction, the luminosity function of galaxies in the mock is in agreement with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) at low redshifts and the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey at high redshifts. A Monte Carlo method is used to assign a \textsuperscript{0.1}(g - r) colour to each galaxy, and the colour distribution of galaxies at different redshifts agrees with measurements from GAMA. The clustering of galaxies in the mock for galaxies in different magnitude and redshift bins is in good agreement with measurements from SDSS and GAMA, and the colour-dependent clustering is in reasonable agreement. We show that the baryon acoustic oscillation can be measured in the mock catalogue, and the redshift-space distortions are in agreement with measurements from SDSS illustrating that this catalogue will be useful for upcoming surveys.},

Our sample of binary quasars, which is about six times larger than any previous spectroscopically confirmed sample on these scales, is targeted using a kernel density estimation (KDE) technique applied to Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) imaging over most of the SDSS area. Our sample is 'complete' in that all of the KDE target pairs with 17.0 $\lessequivlnt$ R $\lessequivlnt$ 36.2 h\textsuperscript{-1} kpc in our area of interest have been spectroscopically confirmed from a combination of previous surveys and our own long-slit observational campaign. We catalogue 230 candidate quasar pairs with angular separations of $<$8 arcsec, from which our binary quasars were identified. We determine the projected correlation function of quasars ($\backslash$bar\{W\}\_p) in four bins of proper transverse scale over the range 17.0 $\lessequivlnt$ R $\lessequivlnt$ 36.2 h\textsuperscript{-1} kpc.

  abstract = {I start by providing an updated summary of the penalized pixel-fitting (pPXF) method, which is used to extract the stellar and gas kinematics, as well as the stellar population of galaxies, via full spectrum fitting. I then focus on the problem of extracting the kinematic when the velocity dispersion \$$\backslash$sigma\$ is smaller than the velocity sampling \$$\backslash$Delta V\$, which is generally, by design, close to the instrumental dispersion \$$\backslash$sigma\_\{$\backslash$rm inst\}\$. The standard approach consists of convolving templates with a discretized kernel, while fitting for its parameters. This is obviously very inaccurate when \$$\backslash$sigma$<\backslash$Delta V/2\$, due to undersampling. Oversampling can prevent this, but it has drawbacks. Here I present a more accurate and efficient alternative. It avoids the evaluation of the under-sampled kernel, and instead directly computes its well-sampled analytic Fourier transform, for use with the convolution theorem. A simple analytic transform exists when the kernel is described by the popular Gauss-Hermite parametrization (which includes the Gaussian as special case) for the line-of-sight velocity distribution. I describe how this idea was implemented in a significant upgrade to the publicly available pPXF software. The key advantage of the new approach is that it provides accurate velocities regardless of \$$\backslash$sigma\$. This is important e.g. for spectroscopic surveys targeting galaxies with \$$\backslash$sigma$\backslash$ll$\backslash$sigma\_\{$\backslash$rm inst\}\$, for galaxy redshift determinations, or for measuring line-of-sight velocities of individual stars. The proposed method could also be used to fix Gaussian convolution algorithms used in today's popular software packages.},

It accurately recovers traditional SED parameters, including M\$\_*\$, SFR and dust attenuation, and reveals previously inaccessible information about the number and duration of star formation episodes and the timing of stellar mass assembly, as well as uncertainties in these quantities. This is done using basis Star Formation Histories (SFHs) chosen by comparing the goodness-of-fit of mock galaxy SEDs to the goodness-of-reconstruction of their SFHs. We train and validate the method using a sample of realistic SFHs at \$z =1\$ drawn from stochastic realisations, semi-analytic models, and a cosmological hydrodynamical galaxy formation simulation. The method is then applied to a sample of 1100 CANDELS GOODS-S galaxies at \$1$<$z$<$1.5\$ to illustrate its capabilities at moderate S/N with 15 photometric bands. Of the six parametrizations of SFHs considered, we adopt linear-exponential, bessel-exponential, lognormal and gaussian SFHs and reject the traditional parametrizations of constant (Top-Hat) and exponential SFHs. We quantify the bias and scatter of each parametrization. \$15$\backslash$\%\$ of galaxies in our CANDELS sample exhibit multiple episodes of star formation, with this fraction decreasing above \$M\_*$>$10\^\{9.5\}M\_$\backslash$odot\$. About \$40$\backslash$\%\$ of the CANDELS galaxies have SFHs whose maximum occurs at or near the epoch of observation. The Dense Basis method is scalable and offers a general approach to a broad class of data-science problems.},

  abstract = {Compressing large data sets to a manageable number of summaries that are informative about the underlying parameters vastly simplifies both frequentist and Bayesian inference. When only simulations are available, these summaries are typically chosen heuristically, so they may inadvertently miss important information. We introduce a simulation-based reinforcement learning technique that trains artificial neural networks to find non-linear functionals of data that maximize Fisher information: information maximizing neural networks (IMNNs). In test cases where the posterior can be derived exactly, likelihood-free inference based on automatically derived IMNN summaries produces nearly exact posteriors, showing that these summaries are good approximations to sufficient statistics. In a series of numerical examples of increasing complexity and astrophysical relevance we show that IMNNs are robustly capable of automatically finding optimal, non-linear summaries of the data even in cases where linear compression fails: inferring the variance of Gaussian signal in the presence of noise; inferring cosmological parameters from mock simulations of the Lyman-\$$\backslash$alpha\$ forest in quasar spectra; and inferring frequency-domain parameters from LISA-like detections of gravitational waveforms. In this final case, the IMNN summary outperforms linear data compression by avoiding the introduction of spurious likelihood maxima. We anticipate that the automatic physical inference method described in this paper will be essential to obtain both accurate and precise cosmological parameter estimates from complex and large astronomical data sets, including those from LSST, Euclid, and WFIRST.},

  abstract = {The covariance matrix of the matter and halo power spectrum and bispectrum are studied. Using a large suite of simulations, we find that the non-Gaussianity in the covariance is significant already at mildly nonlinear scales. We compute the leading disconnected non-Gaussian correction to the matter bispectrum covariance using perturbation theory, and find that the corrections result in good agreement in the mildly nonlinear regime. The shot noise contribution to the halo power spectrum and bispectrum covariance is computed using the Poisson model, and the model yields decent agreement with simulation results. However, when the shot noise is estimated from the individual realization, which is usually done in reality, we find that the halo covariance is substantially reduced and gets close to the Gaussian covariance. This is because most of the non-Gaussianity in the covariance arises from the fluctuations in the Poisson shot noise. We use the measured non-Gaussian covariance to access the information content of the power spectrum and bispectrum. The signal-to-noise ratio, S/N, of the matter and halo power spectrum levels off in the mildly nonlinear regime, \$k $\backslash$sim 0.1 - 0.2 $\backslash$,$\backslash$mathrm\{Mpc\} h\^\{-1\}\$. In the nonlinear regime the S/N of the matter and halo bispectrum increases but much slower than the Gaussian results suggest. We find that both the S/N for power spectrum and bispectrum are overestimated by the Gaussian covariances, but the problem being much more serious for the bispectrum. Because the bispectrum is affected strongly by nonlinearity and shot noise, inclusion of the bispectrum only adds modest amount of S/N compared to that of the power spectrum.},

  abstract = {The covariance matrix of the matter power spectrum is a key element of the statistical analysis of galaxy clustering data. Independent realisations of observational measurements can be used to sample the covariance, nevertheless statistical sampling errors will propagate into the cosmological parameter inference potentially limiting the capabilities of the upcoming generation of galaxy surveys. The impact of these errors as function of the number of independent realisations has been previously evaluated for Gaussian distributed data. However, non-linearities in the late time clustering of matter cause departures from Gaussian statistics. Here, we address the impact of non-Gaussian errors on the sample covariance and precision matrix errors using a large ensemble of numerical N-body simulations. In the range of modes where finite volume effects are negligible (\$0.1$\backslash$lesssim k$\backslash$,[h$\backslash$,\{$\backslash$rm Mpc\^\{-1\}\}]$\backslash$lesssim 1.2\$) we find deviations of the estimated variance of the sample covariance with respect to Gaussian predictions above \$$\backslash$sim 10$\backslash$\%\$ level. These reduce to about \$$\backslash$sim 5$\backslash$\%\$ in the case of the precision matrix. Finally, we perform a Fisher analysis to estimate the effect of covariance errors on the cosmological parameter constraints. In particular, assuming Euclid-like survey characteristics we find that a number of independent realisation larger than \$$\backslash$gtrsim 5000\$ is necessary to reduce the contribution of sample covariance errors to the cosmological parameter uncertainties at sub-percent level. We also show that restricting the analysis to large scales \$k$\backslash$lesssim0.2$\backslash$,h$\backslash$,\{$\backslash$rm Mpc\^\{-1\}\}\$ results in a considerable loss in constraining power, while using the linear covariance to include smaller scales leads to an underestimation of the errors on the cosmological parameters.},

  title = {Robustness of the Covariance Matrix for Galaxy Clustering Measurements},
  abstract = {We present a study on the robustness of the covariance matrix estimation for galaxy clustering measurements depending on the cosmological parameters and galaxy bias. To this end, we have produced 9000 galaxy mock catalogues relying on the effective Zel'dovich approximation implemented in the EZmocks computer code, using different input cosmological models and bias parameters. The reference catalogue has also been produced with this code making our study insensitive to the approximation at least on a relative-qualitative level. Our findings indicate that the covariance matrix is insensitive to the input power spectrum (including \$$\backslash$sigma\_8\$), as long as the 2- and 3-point galaxy clustering measurements agree with the given data. In fact, the covariance matrix shows a bias at small scales (\$r$\backslash$lesssim40 h\^\{-1\}\$Mpc) when the chosen galaxy bias parameters yield a 3-point statistics, which is not compatible with the reference one within the error bars, even though the 2-point statistics agree within 1\%. Nevertheless, the error becomes negligible at large scales making the covariance matrix still reliable for data analysis using only measurements in that regime (e.g., measuring baryon acoustic oscillations). High precision in cosmological parameter estimation is expected for covariance matrices extracted from mock galaxy catalogues which take accurately into account both the 2- and the 3- point statistics. This is independent of whether this is achieved by using the right cosmology and galaxy bias (which are not a priori known) or just any combination of both fitting the net observed galaxy clustering.},

We gain insights into the physics driving halo formation by evaluating the predictive performance of the algorithm when provided with different types of information about the local environment around dark matter particles. The algorithm learns to predict whether or not dark matter particles will end up in haloes of a given mass range, based on spherical overdensities. We show that the resulting predictions match those of spherical collapse approximations such as extended Press-Schechter theory. Additional information on the shape of the local gravitational potential is not able to improve halo collapse predictions; the linear density field contains sufficient information for the algorithm to also reproduce ellipsoidal collapse predictions based on the Sheth-Tormen model. We investigate the algorithm's performance in terms of halo mass and radial position and perform blind analyses on independent initial conditions realisations to demonstrate the generality of our results.},

new statistical technique to quantify the impact on the quenched

steeper than for any other variable considered. We compare to the
Illustris hydrodynamical simulation and the Munich semi-analytic model
(L-Galaxies), finding that our results for centrals are qualitatively
consistent with their predictions for quenching via radio-mode AGN
feedback, hinting at the viability of this process in explaining our
observational trends. However, we also find evidence that quenching in
L-Galaxies is too efficient and quenching in Illustris is not efficient
enough, compared to observations. For satellites, we find strong
evidence that environment affects their quenched fraction at fixed
central velocity dispersion, particularly at lower masses. At higher
masses, satellites behave identically to centrals in their quenching. Of
the environmental parameters considered, local density affects the
quenched fraction of satellites the most at fixed central velocity
dispersion.},

  abstract = {Star formation rate (SFR) distributions of galaxies are often assumed to be bimodal with modes corresponding to star-forming and quiescent galaxies, respectively. Both classes of galaxies are typically studied separately, and SFR distributions of star-forming galaxies are commonly modelled as lognormals. Using both observational data and results from numerical simulations, I argue that this division into star-forming and quiescent galaxies is unnecessary from a theoretical point of view and that the SFR distributions of the whole population can be well fitted by zero-inflated negative binomial distributions. This family of
distributions has three parameters that determine the average SFR of the galaxies in the sample, the scatter relative to the star-forming sequence and the fraction of galaxies with zero SFRs, respectively. The proposed distributions naturally account for (I) the discrete nature of star formation, (II) the presence of 'dead' galaxies with zero SFRs and (III) asymmetric scatter. Excluding 'dead' galaxies, the distribution of log SFR is unimodal with a peak at the star-forming sequence and an extended tail towards low SFRs. However, uncertainties and biases in the SFR measurements can create the appearance of a bimodal distribution.},

  abstract = {Imaging with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will allow 
observations of the bulk of distant galaxies at the epoch of
reionization. The recovery of their properties, such as age, color
excess E(B-V), specific star formation rate (sSFR), and stellar mass,
will mostly rely on spectral energy distribution fitting, based on the
data provided by JWST's two imager cameras, namely the Near Infrared
Camera (NIRCam) and the Mid Infrared Imager (MIRI). In this work we
analyze the effect of choosing different combinations of NIRCam and MIRI
broadband filters, from 0.6 to 7.7 $\mu$m, on the recovery of these
galaxy properties. We performed our tests on a sample of 1542 simulated
galaxies, with known input properties, at z = 7-10. We found that,
with only eight NIRCam broadbands, we can recover the galaxy age within
0.1 Gyr and the color excess within 0.06 mag for 70\% of the galaxies.
Additionally, the stellar masses and sSFR are recovered within 0.2 and
0.3 dex, respectively, at z = 7-9. Instead, at z = 10, no NIRCam
band traces purely the $\lambda$ $>$ 4000 \AA{} regime and the
percentage of outliers in stellar mass (sSFR) increases by $>$20\%
($>$90\%), in comparison to z = 9. The MIRI F560W and F770W bands are
crucial to improve the stellar mass and the sSFR estimation at z = 10.
When nebular emission lines are present, deriving correct galaxy
properties is challenging at any redshift and with any band combination.
In particular, the stellar mass is systematically overestimated in up to
0.3 dex on average with NIRCam data alone and including MIRI
observations only marginally improves the estimation.},

of the SFR-M${_\ast}$ relation at redshifts re than three dex
in stellar mass. To obtain SFR estimates, we utilise mid- and far-IR
photometry when available, and rest-UV fluxes for all the other
galaxies. We perform our analysis in different redshift bins, with two
different methods: 1) a linear regression fitting of all star-forming
galaxies, defined as those with specific SFRs log 10(sSFR/
yr-1) $>$ -9.8, similarly to what is typically done in the
literature; 2) a multi-Gaussian decomposition to identify the galaxy
main sequence (MS), the starburst sequence and the quenched galaxy
cloud. We find that the MS slope becomes flatter when higher stellar
mass cuts are adopted, and that the apparent slope change observed at
high masses depends on the SFR estimation method. In addition, the
multi-Gaussian decomposition reveals the presence of a starburst
population which increases towards low stellar masses and high
redshifts. We find that starbursts make up 5\% of all galaxies at z =
0.5-1.0, while they account for 16\% of galaxies at 2 10(M${_\ast}$/M0) = 8.25-11.25. We
conclude that the dissection of the SFR-M${_\ast}$ in multiple

(ultraviolet) and SDSS photometry to a library of dust-attenuated population synthesis models. For star-forming galaxies, our UV-based SFRs compare remarkably well with those from SDSS-measured emission lines (H$\alpha$). Deviations from perfect agreement are shown to be due to differences in the dust attenuation estimates. In contrast to H$\alpha$ measurements, UV provides reliable SFRs for galaxies with weak H$\alpha$, and where H$\alpha$ is contaminated with AGN emission (1/2 of
the sample). Using full-SED SFRs, we calibrate a simple prescription that uses GALEX far- and near-UV magnitudes to produce dust-corrected SFRs for normal star-forming galaxies. The specific SFR is considered as a function of stellar mass for (1) star-forming galaxies with no AGNs, (2) those hosting an AGN, and (3) galaxies without H$\alpha$ emission. We find that the three have distinct star formation histories, with AGNs lying intermediate between the star-forming and the quiescent galaxies. Star-forming galaxies without an AGN lie on a relatively narrow linear sequence. Remarkably, galaxies hosting a strong AGN appear to represent the massive continuation of this sequence. On the other hand, weak AGNs, while also massive, have lower SFRs, sometimes extending to the realm of quiescent galaxies. We propose an evolutionary sequence for massive galaxies that smoothly connects normal star-forming galaxies to
quiescent galaxies via strong and weak AGNs. We confirm that some galaxies with no H$\alpha$ show signs of star formation in the UV. We
derive a cosmic star formation density at z=0.1 with significantly smaller total error than previous measurements.},

from theories of large-scale structure formation to interpreting the
complex phenomena of galaxy formation and evolution. We develop a novel
statistical method, based on the halo occupation distribution (HOD)
model, to solve for this mapping by jointly fitting the galaxy
clustering and the galaxy-galaxy lensing from the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey (SDSS). The method, called the
iHOD model, extracts maximum
information from the survey by including \texttildelow{}80 per cent more
galaxies than the traditional HOD methods, accounting for the
incompleteness of the stellar mass samples self-consistently. The
derived stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) explains the clustering and
lensing of SDSS galaxies over four decades in stellar mass, while
successfully predicting the observed stellar mass functions (SMFs). By
modelling significantly more galaxies, the
iHOD breaks the degeneracy between
the logarithmic scatter in the stellar mass at fixed halo mass and the
slope of the mean SHMR at high masses, without assuming a strong prior
on the scatter and/or using the SMF as an input. We detect a decline of
the scatter with halo mass, from 0.22\_\{-0.01\}\^\{+0.02\} dex below
1012 h-1 M$\odot$ to 0.18 $\pm$ 0.01
dex at 1014 h-1 M$\odot$. The model
predicts a departure of satellite SMFs from the Schechter form in
massive haloes and a linear scaling of satellite number with halo mass.
The iHOD model can be easily applied
to other spectroscopic data sets, greatly improving statistical
constraints on the SHMR compared to traditional HOD methods within the

  abstract = {Galaxy-galaxy weak lensing is a direct probe of the mean matter distribution around galaxies. The depth and sky coverage of the
Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey yield statistically significant galaxy halo mass measurements over a much wider range of stellar masses (108.75 to 1011.3
M$\odot$) and redshifts (0.2 $<$ z $<$ 0.8) than previous
weak lensing studies. At redshift z \texttildelow{} 0.5, the stellar-to-halo
mass ratio (SHMR) reaches a maximum of 4.0 $\pm$ 0.2 per cent as a
function of halo mass at \texttildelow{}1012.25 M$\odot$. We
find, for the first time from weak lensing alone, evidence for
significant evolution in the SHMR: the peak ratio falls as a function of cosmic time from 4.5 $\pm$ 0.3 per cent at z \texttildelow{} 0.7 to 3.4
$\pm$ 0.2 per cent at z \texttildelow{} 0.3, and shifts to lower stellar mass
haloes. These evolutionary trends are dominated by red galaxies, and are consistent with a model in which the stellar mass above which star formation is quenched ‘downsizes' with cosmic time. In contrast, the SHMR of blue, star-forming galaxies is well fitted by a power law that does not evolve with time. This suggests that blue galaxies form stars at a rate that is balanced with their dark matter accretion in such a way that they evolve along the SHMR locus. The redshift dependence of the SHMR can be used to constrain the evolution of the galaxy population over cosmic time.},

investigated. Our main results are as follows. (1) The measured
relations of halo mass with group luminosity, virial volume and central
galaxy stellar mass, M*, agree very well with predictions
from mock group catalogues constructed from a GALFORM semi-analytical
galaxy formation model implemented in the Millennium $\Lambda$CDM N-body
simulation. (2) The measured relations of halo mass with velocity
dispersion and projected half-abundance radius show weak tension with
mock predictions, hinting at problems in the mock galaxy dynamics and
their small-scale distribution. (3) The median
Mh|M* measured from weak lensing depends more
sensitively on the lognormal dispersion in M* at fixed
Mh than it does on the median M*|Mh.
Our measurements suggest an intrinsic dispersion of
$\sigma$log(M*)\texttildelow{} 0.15. (4) Comparing our mass
estimates with those in the catalogue, we find that the G3Cv5
mass can give biased results when used to select subsets of the group

our weak-lensing measurements, group luminosity is the best single-proxy
estimator of group mass.},

photometric data, obtained from the CFHT Legacy Survey. To interpret the
weak lensing signal around our galaxies, we employ a galaxy-galaxy
lensing halo model which allows us to constrain the halo mass and the
satellite fraction. Our analysis is limited to lenses at redshifts
between 0.2 and 0.4, split into a red and a blue sample. We express the
relationship between dark matter halo mass and baryonic observable as a
power law with pivot points of 10\^\{11\} h\_\{70\}\^\{-2\} L\_\{\{$\odot$\}\} and
2\texttimes{} 10\^\{11\} h\_\{70\}\^\{-2\} M\_\{\{$\odot$\}\} for luminosity and stellar
mass, respectively. For the luminosity-halo mass relation, we find a
slope of 1.32 $\pm$ 0.06 and a normalization of
1.19\^\{+0.06\}\_\{-0.07\}\texttimes{} 10\^\{13\} h\_\{70\}\^\{-1\} M\_\{\{$\odot$\}\} for red

0.18\^\{+0.04\}\_\{-0.05\}\texttimes{} 10\^\{13\} h\_\{70\}\^\{-1\} M\_\{\{$\odot$\}\}. Similarly,
we find a best-fitting slope of 1.36\^\{+0.06\}\_\{-0.07\} and a normalization
of 1.43\^\{+0.11\}\_\{-0.08\}\texttimes{} 10\^\{13\} h\_\{70\}\^\{-1\} M\_\{\{$\odot$\}\} for the

fraction which are satellites inside a larger halo tends to decrease
with luminosity and stellar mass, with the sample being nearly all
satellites for a stellar mass of 2\texttimes{} 109 h\_\{70\}\^\{-2\}
M\_\{\{$\odot$\}\}. The satellite fractions are generally close to zero for
blue lenses, irrespective of luminosity or stellar mass. This, together
with the shallower relation between halo mass and baryonic tracer, is a
direct confirmation from galaxy-galaxy lensing that blue galaxies reside
in less clustered environments than red galaxies. We also find that the
halo model, while matching the lensing signal around red lenses well, is
prone to overpredicting the large-scale signal for faint and less
massive blue lenses. This could be a further indication that these
galaxies tend to be more isolated than assumed.},

detailed investigation of many possible systematic effects that could

detected intrinsic alignment for galaxies within 100h-1kpc of
LRGs which we remove using photometric redshift information. The
resulting lensing signal is consistent with NFW (Navarro, Frenk \&
White) profile dark matter haloes; the singular isothermal sphere (SIS)

galaxies that are satellites. Here, we present observational constraints
from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey on these quantities as a function of
r-band luminosity and stellar mass using galaxy-galaxy weak lensing,
with a total of 351507 lenses. We use stellar masses derived from
spectroscopy and virial halo masses derived from weak gravitational
lensing to determine the efficiency with which baryons in the halo of
the central galaxy have been converted into stars. We find that an
L* galaxy with a stellar mass of 6 \texttimes{}
1010Msolar is hosted by a halo with mass of 1.4
\texttimes{} 1012h-1Msolar, independent of
morphology, yielding baryon conversion efficiencies of
17+10-5 per cent (early-types) and
16+15-6 per cent (late-types) at the 95 per cent
confidence level (statistical, not including systematic uncertainty due
to assumption of a universal initial mass function). We find that for a
given stellar mass, the halo mass is independent of morphology below
Mstellar = 1011Msolar, in contrast to
typically a factor of 2 difference in halo mass between ellipticals and
spirals at a fixed luminosity. This suggests that stellar mass is a good
proxy for halo mass in this range and should be used preferentially
whenever a halo mass selected sample is needed. For higher stellar
masses, the conversion efficiency is a declining function of stellar
mass, and the differences in halo mass between early- and late-types
become larger, reflecting the fact that most group and cluster haloes
with masses above 1013Msolar host ellipticals at
the centre, while even the brightest central spirals are hosted by
haloes of mass below 1013Msolar. We find that the
fraction of spirals that are satellites is roughly 10-15 per cent
independent of stellar mass or luminosity, while for ellipticals this
fraction decreases with stellar mass from 50 per cent at
1010Msolar to 10 per cent at 3 \texttimes{}
1011Msolar or 20 per cent at the maximum
luminosity considered. We split the elliptical sample by local density,
and find that at a given luminosity there is no difference in the signal
on scales below 100h-1kpc between high- and low-density
regions, suggesting that tidal stripping inside large haloes does not
remove most of the DM from the early-type satellites. This result is
dominated by haloes in the mass range
1013-1014h-1Msolar, and is
an average over all separations from the group or cluster centre.},

  abstract = {Using data from the COSMOS survey, we perform the first joint analysis 
of galaxy-galaxy weak lensing, galaxy spatial clustering, and galaxy
number densities. Carefully accounting for sample variance and for
scatter between stellar and halo mass, we model all three observables
simultaneously using a novel and self-consistent theoretical framework.
Our results provide strong constraints on the shape and redshift
evolution of the stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) from z = 0.2 to z
= 1. At low stellar mass, we find that halo mass scales as Mh
vpropM 0.46 * and that this scaling does not
evolve significantly with redshift from z = 0.2 to z = 1. The slope of
the SHMR rises sharply at M * $>$ 5 \texttimes{} 1010
M $\odot$ and as a consequence, the stellar mass of a central
galaxy becomes a poor tracer of its parent halo mass. We show that the
dark-to-stellar ratio, Mh /M *, varies from low to
high masses, reaching a minimum of Mh /M * \textasciitilde{} 27 at
M * = 4.5 \texttimes{} 1010 M $\odot$ and
Mh = 1.2 \texttimes{} 1012 M $\odot$. This
minimum is important for models of galaxy formation because it marks the
mass at which the accumulated stellar growth of the central galaxy has
been the most efficient. We describe the SHMR at this minimum in terms
of the "pivot stellar mass," M piv *, the "pivot
halo mass," M piv h , and the "pivot ratio,"
(Mh /M *)piv. Thanks to a homogeneous
analysis of a single data set spanning a large redshift range, we report
the first detection of mass downsizing trends for both M piv
 h and M piv *. The pivot stellar mass
decreases from M piv * = 5.75 $\pm$ 0.13
\texttimes{} 1010 M $\odot$ at z = 0.88 to M
piv * = 3.55 $\pm$ 0.17 \texttimes{} 1010
M $\odot$ at z = 0.37. Intriguingly, however, the corresponding
evolution of M piv h leaves the pivot ratio
constant with redshift at (Mh /M *)piv
\textasciitilde{} 27. We use simple arguments to show how this result raises the
possibility that star formation quenching may ultimately depend on
Mh /M * and not simply on Mh , as is
commonly assumed. We show that simple models with such a dependence
naturally lead to downsizing in the sites of star formation. Finally, we
discuss the implications of our results in the context of popular
quenching models, including disk instabilities and active galactic
nucleus feedback.

Specifically, we consider central velocity dispersion (\$$\backslash$sigma\_\{c\}\$), stellar, halo, bulge and disk mass, local density, bulge-to-total ratio, group-centric distance and galaxy-halo mass ratio. We develop and apply a new statistical technique to quantify the impact on the quenched fraction (\$f\_\{$\backslash$rm Quench\}\$) of varying one parameter, while keeping the remaining parameters fixed. For centrals, we find that the \$f\_\{$\backslash$rm Quench\} - $\backslash$sigma\_\{c\}\$ relationship is tighter and steeper than for any other variable considered. We compare to the Illustris hydrodynamical simulation and the Munich semi-analytic model (L-Galaxies), finding that our results for centrals are qualitatively consistent with their predictions for quenching via radio-mode AGN feedback, hinting at the viability of this process in explaining our observational trends. However, we also find evidence that quenching in L-Galaxies is too efficient and quenching in Illustris is not efficient enough, compared to observations. For satellites, we find strong evidence that environment affects their quenched fraction at fixed central velocity dispersion, particularly at lower masses. At higher masses, satellites behave identically to centrals in their quenching. Of the environmental parameters considered, local density affects the quenched fraction of satellites the most at fixed central velocity dispersion.},

The Galaxy and Mass Assembly project (GAMA) combines a spectroscopic survey with photometric information in 21 bands from the far-ultraviolet (FUV) to the far-infrared (FIR). Stellar masses and dust-corrected star-formation rates (SFR) are derived from spectral energy distribution (SED) modelling using MAGPHYS. We use the GAMA galaxy group catalogue to examine the variation of the fraction of star-forming galaxies (SFG) and properties of the MS with respect to the environment. Results. We examine the environmental dependence for stellar mass selected samples without preselecting star-forming galaxies and study any dependence on the host halo mass separately for centrals and satellites out to z \textasciitilde{} 0.3. We find the SFR distribution at fixed stellar mass can be described by the combination of two Gaussians (referred to as the star-forming Gaussian and the quiescent Gaussian). Using the observed bimodality to define SFG, we investigate how the fraction of SFG F(SFG) and properties of the MS change with environment. For centrals, the position of the MS is similar to the field but with a larger scatter. No significant dependence on halo mass is observed. For satellites, the position of the MS is almost always lower (by \textasciitilde{}0.2 dex) compared to the field and the width is almost always larger. F(SFG) is similar between centrals (in different halo mass bins) and field galaxies. However, for satellites F(SFG) decreases with increasing halo mass and this dependence is stronger towards lower redshift.},

  abstract = {Given the precision of current neutrino data, priors still impact noticeably the constraints on neutrino masses and their hierarchy. To avoid our understanding of neutrinos being driven by prior assumptions, we construct a prior that is mathematically minimally informative. Using the constructed uninformative prior, we find that the normal hierarchy is favoured but with inconclusive posterior odds of 5.1:1. Better data is hence needed before the neutrino masses and their hierarchy can be well constrained. We find that the next decade of cosmological data should provide conclusive evidence if the normal hierarchy with negligible minimum mass is correct, and if the uncertainty in the sum of neutrino masses drops below 0.025 eV. On the other hand, if neutrinos obey the inverted hierarchy, achieving strong evidence will be difficult with the same uncertainties. Our uninformative prior was constructed from principles of the Objective Bayesian approach. The prior is called a reference prior and is minimally informative in the specific sense that the information gain after collection of data is maximised. The prior is computed for the combination of neutrino oscillation data and cosmological data and still applies if the data improve.},

  title = {Scale-Dependent Galaxy Bias, {{CMB}} Lensing-Galaxy Cross-Correlation, and Neutrino Masses},
  abstract = {One of the most powerful cosmological datasets when it comes to constraining neutrino masses is represented by galaxy power spectrum measurements, \$P\_\{gg\}(k)\$. The constraining power of \$P\_\{gg\}(k)\$ is however severely limited by uncertainties in the modeling of the scale-dependent galaxy bias \$b(k)\$. In this Letter we present a new method to constrain \$b(k)\$ by using the cross-correlation between the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) lensing signal and galaxy maps (\$C\_$\backslash$ell\^\{$\backslash$rm $\backslash$kappa g\}\$) using a simple but theoretically well-motivated parametrization for \$b(k)\$. We apply the method using \$C\_$\backslash$ell\^\{$\backslash$rm $\backslash$kappa g\}\$ measured by cross-correlating Planck lensing maps and the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) Data Release 11 (DR11) CMASS galaxy sample, and \$P\_\{gg\}(k)\$ measured from the BOSS DR12 CMASS sample. We detect a non-zero scale-dependence at moderate significance, which suggests that a proper modeling of \$b(k)\$ is necessary in order to reduce the impact of non-linearities and minimize the corresponding systematics. The accomplished increase in constraining power of \$P\_\{gg\}(k)\$ is demonstrated by determining a 95\% C.L. upper bound on the sum of the three active neutrino masses \$M\_\{$\backslash$nu\}\$ of \$M\_\{$\backslash$nu\}$<$0.19$\backslash$, \{$\backslash$rm eV\}\$. This limit represents a significant improvement over previous bounds with comparable datasets. Our method will prove especially powerful and important as future large-scale structure surveys will overlap more significantly with the CMB lensing kernel providing a large cross-correlation signal.},

In this approach, galaxies of a given type are probabilistically assigned to individual halos in N-body simulations. In this paper, we present a fast emulator for predicting the fully nonlinear galaxy-galaxy auto and galaxy-dark matter cross power spectrum and correlation function over a range of freely specifiable HOD modeling parameters. The emulator is constructed using results from 100 HOD models run on a large
$\Lambda$CDM N-body simulation, with Gaussian Process interpolation
applied to a PCA-based representation of the galaxy power spectrum. The total error is currently \texttildelow{}1\% in the auto correlations and \texttildelow{}2\% in the cross correlations from z = 1 to z = 0, over the considered
parameter range. We use the emulator to investigate the accuracy of various analytic prescriptions for the galaxy power spectrum, parametric dependencies in the HOD model, and the behavior of galaxy bias as a function of HOD parameters. Additionally, we obtain fully nonlinear predictions for tangential shear correlations induced by
galaxy-galaxy lensing from our galaxy-dark matter cross
power spectrum emulator. All emulation products are publicly available

  shorttitle = {Conservative Cosmology},
  abstract = {When combining data sets to perform parameter inference, the results will be unreliable if there are unknown systematics in data or models. Here we introduce a flexible methodology, BACCUS: BAyesian Conservative Constraints and Unknown Systematics, which deals in a conservative way with the problem of data combination, for any degree of tension between experiments. We introduce hyperparameters that describe a bias in each model parameter for each class of experiments. A conservative posterior for the model parameters is then obtained by marginalization both over these unknown shifts and over the width of their prior. We contrast this approach with an existing hyperparameter method in which each individual likelihood is scaled, comparing the performance of each approach and their combination in application to some idealized models. Using only these rescaling hyperparameters is not a suitable approach for the current observational situation, in which internal null tests of the errors are passed, and yet different experiments prefer models that are in poor agreement. The possible existence of large shift systematics cannot be constrained with a small number of data sets, leading to extended tails on the conservative posterior distributions. We illustrate our method with the case of the \$H\_0\$ tension between results from the cosmic distance ladder and physical measurements that rely on the standard cosmological model.},

  abstract = {Using a sample of 4 galaxy clusters at \$1.35 $<$ z $<$ 1.65\$ and 10 galaxy clusters at \$0.85 $<$ z $<$ 1.35\$, we measure the environmental quenching timescale, \$t\_Q\$, corresponding to the time required after a galaxy is accreted by a cluster for it to fully cease star formation. Cluster members are selected by a photometric-redshift criterion, and categorized as star-forming, quiescent, or intermediate according to their dust-corrected rest-frame colors and magnitudes. We employ a "delayed-then-rapid" quenching model that relates a simulated cluster mass accretion rate to the observed numbers of each type of galaxy in the cluster to constrain \$t\_Q\$. For galaxies of mass \$M\_* $\backslash$gtrsim 10\^\{10.5\}\textasciitilde{} $\backslash$mathrm\{M\}\_$\backslash$odot\$, we find a quenching timescale of \$t\_Q=\$ 1.24 Gyr in the \$z$\backslash$sim1.5\$ cluster sample, and \$t\_Q=\$ 1.50 Gyr at \$z$\backslash$sim1\$. Using values drawn from the literature, we compare the redshift evolution of \$t\_Q\$ to timescales predicted for different physical quenching mechanisms. We find \$t\_Q\$ to depend on host halo mass such that quenching occurs over faster timescales in clusters relative to groups, suggesting that properties of the host halo are responsible for quenching high-mass galaxies. The environmental quenching timescale evolves faster from \$z=0\$ to \$z=1.5\$ than the molecular gas depletion timescale and slower than an SFR-outflow timescale, but is consistent with the evolution of the dynamical time. Between \$z=0\$ and \$z=1.5\$, we find that \$t\_Q\$ evolves faster than the molecular gas depletion timescale and slower than an SFR-outflow timescale, but is consistent with the evolution of the dynamical time. This suggests that environmental quenching in these galaxies is driven by the motion of satellites relative to the cluster environment, although due to uncertainties in the atomic gas budget at high redshift, we cannot rule out quenching due to simple gas depletion.},

Here we consider extending machine learning algorithms to operate on groups of data points. We suggest treating a group of data points as an i.i.d. sample set from an underlying feature distribution for that group. Our approach employs kernel machines with a kernel on i.i.d. sample sets of vectors. We define certain kernel functions on pairs of distributions, and then use a nonparametric estimator to consistently estimate those functions based on sample sets. The projection of the estimated Gram matrix to the cone of symmetric positive semi-definite matrices enables us to use kernel machines for classification, regression, anomaly detection, and low-dimensional embedding in the space of distributions. We present several numerical experiments both on real and simulated datasets to demonstrate the advantages of our new approach.},

the power spectrum of these galaxies with redshifts 0.43 $<$ z $<$ 0.7
in order to constrain the amount of local non-Gaussianity,
f\{\_N\_L\^local\}, in the primordial density field, paying particular
attention to the impact of systematic uncertainties. The BOSS galaxy
density field is systematically affected by the local stellar density
and this influences the ability to accurately measure f\{\_N\_L\^local\}. In
the absence of any correction, we find (erroneously) that the
probability that f\{\_N\_L\^local\} is greater than zero, P(f\{\_N\_L\^local\}
$>$ 0), is 99.5 per cent. After quantifying and correcting for the
systematic bias and including the added uncertainty, we find - 45 $<$
f\{\_N\_L\^local\} $<$ 195 at 95 per cent confidence and P(f\{\_N\_L\^local\}
$>$ 0) = 91.0 per cent. A more conservative approach assumes that we
have only learnt the k dependence of the systematic bias and allows any
amplitude for the systematic correction; we find that the systematic
effect is not fully degenerate with that of f\{\_N\_L\^local\}, and we
determine that -82 $<$ f\{\_N\_L\^local\} $<$ 178 (at 95 per cent
confidence) and P(f\{\_N\_L\^local\} $>$ 0) = 68 per cent. This analysis
demonstrates the importance of accounting for the impact of Galactic
foregrounds on f\{\_N\_L\^local\} measurements. We outline the methods that

A Monte Carlo HOD method is used to assign galaxies to the halo lightcone catalogue, and we evolve the HODs to reproduce a target luminosity function; by construction, the luminosity function of galaxies in the mock is in agreement with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) at low redshifts and the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey at high redshifts. A Monte Carlo method is used to assign a
0.1(g - r) colour to each galaxy, and the colour distribution of galaxies at different redshifts agrees with measurements from GAMA. The clustering of galaxies in the mock for galaxies in different magnitude and redshift bins is in good agreement with measurements from SDSS and GAMA, and the colour-dependent clustering is in reasonable agreement. We show that the baryon acoustic oscillation can be measured in the mock catalogue, and the redshift-space distortions are in agreement with measurements from SDSS illustrating that this catalogue will be useful for upcoming surveys.},

000 galaxies over 280 deg2, to a limiting magnitude of rpet $<$ 19.8 mag. The target galaxies are distributed over 0 $<$ z $\lessequivlnt$ 0.5 with a median redshift of z $\approx$ 0.2, although the
redshift distribution includes a small number of systems, primarily quasars, at higher redshifts, up to and beyond z = 1. The redshift accuracy ranges from $\sigma$v $\approx$ 50 km s-1 to
$\sigma$v $\approx$ 100 km s-1 depending on the
signal-to-noise ratio of the spectrum. Here we describe the GAMA spectroscopic reduction and analysis pipeline. We present the steps involved in taking the raw two-dimensional spectroscopic images through to flux-calibrated one-dimensional spectra. The resulting GAMA spectra cover an observed wavelength range of 3750 $\lessequivlnt$ $\lambda$ $\lessequivlnt$ 8850
\AA{} at a resolution of R $\approx$ 1300. The final flux calibration is
typically accurate to 10-20 per cent, although the reliability is worse at the extreme wavelength ends, and poorer in the blue than the red. We present details of the measurement of emission and absorption features in the GAMA spectra. These measurements are characterized through a variety of quality control analyses detailing the robustness and reliability of the measurements. We illustrate the quality of the measurements with a brief exploration of elementary emission line properties of the galaxies in the GAMA sample. We demonstrate the luminosity dependence of the Balmer decrement, consistent with
previously published results, and explore further how Balmer decrement varies with galaxy mass and redshift. We also investigate the mass and redshift dependencies of the [N II]/H$\alpha$ versus [O III]/H$\beta$
spectral diagnostic diagram, commonly used to discriminate between star forming and nuclear activity in galaxies.},

Our sample is based on the NASA-Sloan Atlas which is a reanalysis of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 8. We examine the relative number of quenched versus star-forming dwarf galaxies, defining quenched galaxies as having no H$\alpha$ emission
(EWH$\alpha$ $<$ 2 \AA{}) and a strong 4000 \AA{} break.
The fraction of quenched dwarf galaxies decreases rapidly with
increasing distance from a massive host, leveling off for distances beyond 1.5 Mpc. We define galaxies beyond 1.5 Mpc of a massive host galaxy to be in the field. We demonstrate that there is a stellar mass threshold of M stellar $<$ 1.0 \texttimes{} 109 M
$\odot$ below which quenched galaxies do not exist in the
field. Below this threshold, we find that none of the 2951 field dwarf galaxies are quenched; all field dwarf galaxies show evidence for recent star formation. Correcting for volume effects, this corresponds to a 1$\sigma$ upper limit on the quenched fraction of 0.06\%. In more dense
environments, quenched galaxies account for 23\% of the dwarf population over the same stellar mass range. The majority of quenched dwarf galaxies (often classified as dwarf elliptical galaxies) are within 2 virial radii of a massive galaxy, and only a few percent of quenched dwarf galaxies exist beyond 4 virial radii. Thus, for galaxies with stellar mass less than 1.0 \texttimes{} 109 M $\odot$,
ending star formation requires the presence of a more massive neighbor, providing a stringent constraint on models of star formation feedback.},

The model includes 15 parameters, including both cosmological and galaxy bias parameters. We demonstrate that our emulator achieves \textasciitilde{} 1\% precision at the scales of interest, 0.1$<$r$<$10 h\^\{-1\} Mpc, and recovers the true cosmology when tested against independent simulations. Our primary parameters of interest are related to the growth rate of structure, f, and its degenerate combination fsigma\_8. Using this emulator, we show that the constraining power on these parameters monotonically increases as smaller scales are included in the analysis, all the way down to 0.1 h\^\{-1\} Mpc. For a BOSS-like survey, the constraints on fsigma\_8 from r$<$30 h\^\{-1\} Mpc scales alone are more than a factor of two tighter than those from the fiducial BOSS analysis of redshift-space clustering using perturbation theory at larger scales. The combination of real- and redshift-space clustering allows us to break the degeneracy between f and sigma\_8, yielding a 9\% constraint on f alone for a BOSS-like analysis. The current AEMULUS simulations limit this model to surveys of massive galaxies. Future simulations will allow this framework to be extended to all galaxy target types, including emission-line galaxies.},

We present a halo mass function emulator and demonstrate improved accuracy relative to state-of-the-art analytic models. In this work, mass is defined using an overdensity criteria of 200 relative to the mean background density. Our emulator is constructed from the AEMULUS simulations, a suite of 40 N-body simulations with snapshots from z=3 to z=0. These simulations cover the flat wCDM parameter space allowed by recent Cosmic Microwave Background, Baryon Acoustic Oscillation and Type Ia Supernovae results, varying the parameters w, Omega\_m, Omega\_b, sigma\_8, N\_\{eff\}, n\_s, and H\_0. We validate our emulator using five realizations of seven different cosmologies, for a total of 35 test simulations. These test simulations were not used in constructing the emulator, and were run with fully independent initial conditions. We use our test simulations to characterize the modeling uncertainty of the emulator, and introduce a novel way of marginalizing over the associated systematic uncertainty. We confirm non-universality in our halo mass function emulator as a function of both cosmological parameters and redshift. Our emulator achieves better than 1\% precision over much of the relevant parameter space, and we demonstrate that the systematic uncertainty in our emulator will remain a negligible source of error for cluster abundance studies through at least the LSST Year 1 data set.},

  abstract = {The rapidly growing statistical precision of galaxy surveys has lead to a need for ever-more precise predictions of the observables used to constrain cosmological and galaxy formation models. The primary avenue through which such predictions will be obtained is suites of numerical simulations. These simulations must span the relevant model parameter spaces, be large enough to obtain the precision demanded by upcoming data, and be thoroughly validated in order to ensure accuracy. In this paper we present one such suite of simulations, forming the basis for the AEMULUS Project, a collaboration devoted to precision emulation of galaxy survey observables. We have run a set of 75 (1.05 h\^-1 Gpc)\^3 simulations with mass resolution and force softening of 3.51$\backslash$times 10\^10 (Omega\_m / 0.3) \textasciitilde{} h\^-1 M\_sun and 20 \textasciitilde{} h\^-1 kpc respectively in 47 different wCDM cosmologies spanning the range of parameter space allowed by the combination of recent Cosmic Microwave Background, Baryon Acoustic Oscillation and Type Ia Supernovae results. We present convergence tests of several observables including spherical overdensity halo mass functions, galaxy projected correlation functions, galaxy clustering in redshift space, and matter and halo correlation functions and power spectra. We show that these statistics are converged to 1\% (2\%) for halos with more than 500 (200) particles respectively and scales of r$>$200 \textasciitilde{} h\^-1 kpc in real space or k \textasciitilde{} 3 h Mpc\^-1 in harmonic space for z$\backslash$le 1. We find that the dominant source of uncertainty comes from varying the particle loading of the simulations. This leads to large systematic errors for statistics using halos with fewer than 200 particles and scales smaller than k \textasciitilde{} 4 h\^-1 Mpc.

  title = {Realm of the {{Nebulae}}},
  abstract = {No modern astronomer made a more profound contribution to our understanding  
of the cosmos than did Edwin Hubble, who first conclusively demonstrated that
the universe is expanding.  Basing his theory on the observation of the
change in spectra of distant galaxies, called red shift, Hubble showed that
this is a Doppler effect, or alteration in the wavelength of light, resulting
from the rapid motion of celestial objects away from Earth.

Hubble's discovery confirmed an equation previously arrived at by Einstein --
who, however, had not trusted his own figures until Hubble proved their
accuracy.  Hubble supported his theory with careful measurements, but found a
rate of expansion (called Hubble's constant) that was far too high because he
assumed that other galaxies were much nearer our Milky Way than they are.
On the other hand, Hubble's law, relating the distance of a galaxy to its
recession velocity, remains essentially unchanged.

In 1935 Hubble described his principal observations and conclusions in the
Silliman lectures at Yale University.  These lectures were published the
following year as The Realm of the Nebulae, which quickly became a classic
work.  It is here reprinted with an introduction by James E. Gunn.},

the disk component of galaxies. Finally, the data also indicate a trend

Redshift-space distortions affect early- and late-type galaxies in
different ways. In particular, at small separations the dominant effect
comes from virialized cluster cores, where ellipticals are the dominant
population. The net result is that a meaningful comparison of the
clustering strength of different morphological types can be performed
only in real space, i.e., after projecting out the redshift distortions
on the two-point correlation function $\xi$(rp, $\pi$). A
power-law fit to the projected function wp(rp) on
scales smaller than 10 h-1 Mpc gives
r0=8.35+0.75-0.76 h-1 Mpc,
$\gamma$=2.05+0.10-0.08 for the early-type
population, and r0=5.55+0.40-0.45
h-1 Mpc, $\gamma$=1.73+0.07-0.08 for
spirals and irregulars. These values are derived for a sample luminosity
limited to MZw $<$= -19.5. We detect a 25\% increase of
r0 with luminosity for all types combined, from
MZw = -19 to -20. In the framework of a simple stable
clustering model for the mean streaming of pairs, we estimate
$\sigma$12(1), the one-dimensional pairwise velocity
dispersion between 0 and 1 h-1 Mpc, to be
865+250-165 km s-1 for early-type
galaxies and 345+95-65 km s-1 for late
types. This latter value should be a fair estimate of the pairwise
dispersion for ‘‘field'' galaxies; it is stable with respect to the
presence or absence of clusters in the sample, and is consistent with
the values found for noncluster galaxies and IRAS galaxies at similar
separations.},

galaxies with moderate luminosities
(L8$\mu$m$<$1011 Lsolar), we find that
the SFR can be estimated consistently from the multiwavelength data
based on local luminosity correlations. However, 20\%-30\% of massive
galaxies, and nearly all those with
L8$\mu$m$>$1011 Lsolar, show a mid-IR
excess that is likely due to the presence of obscured active nuclei, as
shown in a companion paper. There is a tight and roughly linear
correlation between stellar mass and SFR for 24 $\mu$m-detected galaxies.
For a given mass, the SFR at z=2 was larger by a factor of \textasciitilde{}4 and \textasciitilde{}30
relative to that in star-forming galaxies at z=1 and 0, respectively.
Typical ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) at z=2 are relatively
‘‘transparent'' to ultraviolet light, and their activity is long lived
($>$\textasciitilde{}400 Myr), unlike that in local ULIRGs and high-redshift
submillimeter-selected galaxies. ULIRGs are the common mode of star
formation in massive galaxies at z=2, and the high duty cycle suggests
that major mergers are not the dominant trigger for this activity.
Current galaxy formation models underpredict the normalization of the
mass-SFR correlation by about a factor of 4 and the space density of
ULIRGs by an order of magnitude but give better agreement for z$>$1.4

  abstract = {Using data from the mid-infrared to millimeter wavelengths for 
individual galaxies and for stacked ensembles at 0.5 $<$ z $<$ 2, we
derive robust estimates of dust masses (M dust) for
main-sequence (MS) galaxies, which obey a tight correlation between star
formation rate (SFR) and stellar mass (M *), and for
starbursting galaxies that fall outside that relation. Exploiting the
correlation of gas-to-dust mass with metallicity (M gas/M
dust-Z), we use our measurements to constrain the gas
content, CO-to-H2 conversion factors ($\alpha$CO),
and star formation efficiencies (SFE) of these distant galaxies. Using
large statistical samples, we confirm that $\alpha$CO and SFE
are an order of magnitude higher and lower, respectively, in MS galaxies
at high redshifts compared to the values of local galaxies with
equivalently high infrared luminosities (L IR $>$
1012 L $\odot$). For galaxies within the MS, we
show that the variations of specific star formation rates (sSFRs = SFR/M
*) are driven by varying gas fractions. For relatively
massive galaxies like those in our samples, we show that the hardness of
the radiation field, langUrang, which is proportional to the
dust-mass-weighted luminosity (L IR/M dust) and
the primary parameter defining the shape of the IR spectral energy
distribution (SED), is equivalent to SFE/Z. For MS galaxies with stellar
mass log (M */M $\odot$) $>$= 9.7 we measure this
quantity, langUrang, showing that it does not depend significantly on
either the stellar mass or the sSFR. This is explained as a simple
consequence of the existing correlations between SFR-M *, M
*-Z, and M gas-SFR. Instead, we show that
langUrang (or equally L IR/M dust) does evolve,
with MS galaxies having harder radiation fields and thus warmer
temperatures as redshift increases from z = 0 to 2, a trend that can
also be understood based on the redshift evolution of the M
*-Z and SFR-M * relations. These results motivate
the construction of a universal set of SED templates for MS galaxies
that are independent of their sSFR or M * but vary as a
function of redshift with only one parameter, langUrang.},

sstarf. However, if we select only blue galaxies we find a linear relation SFRvpropM sstarf, similar to previous results at z = 0 by Peng et al. This selection excludes red, dusty, star-forming galaxies with higher masses, which brings down the slope. By selecting on L IR/L UV (a proxy for dust obscuration) and the rest-frame U - V colors, we show that star-forming galaxies fall in three distinct regions of the log(SFR)-log(M sstarf) plane: (1) actively star-forming galaxies with "normal" dust obscuration and associated colors (54\% for log (M sstarf) $>$ 10 at 1 $<$ z $<$ 1.5), (2) red star-forming galaxies with low levels of dust
obscuration and low-specific SFRs (11\%), and (3) dusty, blue
star-forming galaxies with high-specific SFRs (7\%). The remaining 28\% comprises quiescent galaxies. Galaxies on the "normal" star formation sequence show strong trends of increasing dust attenuation with stellar mass and a decreasing specific SFR, with an observed scatter of 0.25 dex. The dusty, blue galaxies reside in the upper envelope of the star formation sequence with remarkably similar spectral shapes at all masses, suggesting that the same physical process is dominating the stellar light. The red, low-dust star-forming galaxies may be in the process of shutting off and migrating to the quiescent population.},

  abstract = {Passive red galaxies frequently contain warm ionized gas and have spectra similar to low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions
(LINERs). Here we investigate the nature of the ionizing sources powering this emission, by comparing nuclear spectroscopy from the Palomar survey with larger aperture data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We find the line emission in the majority of passive red galaxies is spatially extended; the H$\alpha$ surface brightness profile depends on radius r as r -1.28. We detect strong line ratio gradients with radius in [N II]/H$\alpha$, [S II]/H$\alpha$, and [O
III]/[S II], requiring the ionization parameter to increase outward. Combined with a realistic gas density profile, this outward increasing ionization parameter convincingly rules out active galactic nuclei (AGNs) as the dominant ionizing source and strongly favors distributed ionizing sources. Sources that follow the stellar density profile can additionally reproduce the observed luminosity dependence of the line ratio gradient. Post-asymptotic giant branch stars provide a natural ionization source candidate, though they have an ionization parameter deficit. Velocity width differences among different emission lines disfavor shocks as the dominant ionization mechanism, and suggest that the interstellar medium in these galaxies contains multiple components. We conclude that the line emission in most LINER-like galaxies found in large-aperture ($>$100 pc) spectroscopy is not primarily powered by AGN activity and thus does not trace the AGN bolometric luminosity. However, they can be used to trace warm gas in these red galaxies.},

Within its virial radius this model contains about 2\texttimes{}107 dark

This baryonic modelling is tuned so that our simulations reproduce the observed properties of isolated spirals outside clusters. Without further parameter adjustment our simulations then produce a luminosity function, a mass-to-light ratio, luminosity, number and velocity dispersion profiles, and a morphology-radius relation which are similar to those observed in real clusters. In particular, since our simulations follow galaxy merging explicitly, we can demonstrate that it accounts quantitatively for the observed cluster population of bulges and elliptical galaxies.},

excellent recovery of halo properties; we expand on these comparisons
with more tests and higher-resolution simulations. We show a significant
improvement in substructure recovery compared to several other halo
finders and discuss the theoretical and practical limits of simulations
in this regard. Finally, we present results that demonstrate
conclusively that dark matter halo cores are not at rest relative to the
halo bulk or substructure average velocities and have coherent velocity
offsets across a wide range of halo masses and redshifts. For massive

Some of the relationships between parameters, in particular the color-magnitude relations, show stronger correlations for exponential galaxies and concentrated galaxies taken separately than for all galaxies taken together.

\texttimes{} 1010 Msolar. Lower-mass galaxies have
young stellar populations, low surface mass densities and the low
concentrations typical of discs. Their star formation histories are more
strongly correlated with surface mass density than with stellar mass. A
significant fraction of the lowest-mass galaxies in our sample have
experienced recent starbursts. At given stellar mass, the sizes of
low-mass galaxies are lognormally distributed with dispersion
$\sigma$(lnR50) \textasciitilde{} 0.5, in excellent agreement with the idea
that they form with little angular momentum loss through cooling and
condensation in a gravitationally dominant dark matter halo. Their
median stellar surface mass density scales with stellar mass as
$\mu$*\textasciitilde{}M0.54*, suggesting that the
stellar mass of a disc galaxy is proportional to the three halves power
of its halo mass. All of this suggests that the efficiency of the
conversion of baryons into stars in low-mass galaxies increases in
proportion to halo mass, perhaps as a result of supernova feedback
processes. At stellar masses above 3 \texttimes{} 1010
Msolar, there is a rapidly increasing fraction of galaxies
with old stellar populations, high surface mass densities and the high
concentrations typical of bulges. In this regime, the size distribution
remains lognormal, but its dispersion decreases rapidly with increasing
mass and the median stellar mass surface density is approximately
constant. This suggests that the star formation efficiency decreases in
the highest-mass haloes, and that little star formation occurs in
massive galaxies after they have assembled.},

extragalactic fields GOODS-North, GOODS-South, UDS, and COSMOS obtained
within the GOODS-Herschel and CANDELS-Herschel key programs. The star
formation picture provided by a total of 10 497 individual far-infrared
detections is supplemented by the stacking analysis of a mass complete
sample of 62 361 star-forming galaxies from the Hubble Space Telescope
(HST) H band-selected catalogs of the CANDELS survey and from two deep
ground-based Ks band-selected catalogs in the GOODS-North and
the COSMOS-wide field to obtain one of the most accurate and unbiased
understanding to date of the stellar mass growth over the cosmic
history. We show, for the first time, that stacking also provides a
powerful tool to determine the dispersion of a physical correlation and
describe our method called "scatter stacking", which may be easily
generalized to other experiments. The combination of direct UV and
far-infrared UV-reprocessed light provides a complete census on the star
formation rates (SFRs), allowing us to demonstrate that galaxies at z =
4 to 0 of all stellar masses (M${_\ast}$) follow a universal
scaling law, the so-called main sequence of star-forming galaxies. We
find a universal close-to-linear slope of the log 10(SFR)-log
10(M${_\ast}$) relation, with evidence for a
flattening of the main sequence at high masses (log
10(M${_\ast}$/M$\odot$) $>$ 10.5) that
becomesless prominent with increasing redshift and almost vanishes by z
$\simeq$ 2. This flattening may be due to the parallel stellar growth of
quiescent bulges in star-forming galaxies, which mostly happens over the
same redshift range. Within the main sequence, we measure a nonvarying
SFR dispersion of 0.3 dex: at a fixed redshift and stellar mass, about
68\% of star-forming galaxies form stars at a universal rate within a
factor 2. The specific SFR (sSFR = SFR/M${_\ast}$) of
star-forming galaxies is found to continuously increase from z = 0 to 4.
Finally we discuss the implications of our findings on the cosmic SFR
history and on the origin of present-day stars: more than two-thirds of
present-day stars must have formed in a regime dominated by the "main
sequence" mode. As a consequence we conclude that, although omnipresent
in the distant Universe, galaxy mergers had little impact in shaping the
global star formation history over the last 12.5 billion years.

An empirical relation between the distribution functions of total
stellar mass of galaxies and host halo mass, tuned to match the spatial
density of galaxies over 0 $<$ z $<$ 2 and the clustering properties
at z \texttildelow{} 0, is extended to include two different scenarios
describing the variation of SFR on Mh. We also present new
measurements of the redshift evolution of the average SFR for
star-forming galaxies of different stellar masses up to z = 2, using
data from the Herschel Multi-tiered Extragalactic Survey for infrared
bright galaxies.

Combining the EHM with the halo accretion histories from numerical
simulations, we trace the stellar mass growth and star-formation history
in haloes spanning a range of masses. We find that: (1) the intensity of
the star-forming activity in haloes in the probed mass range has
steadily decreased from z \texttildelow{} 2 to 0; (2) at a given epoch, haloes
in the mass range between a few times 1011 M$\odot$

at hosting star formation; (3) the peak of SFR density shifts to lower
mass haloes over time; and (4) galaxies that are forming stars most
actively at z \texttildelow{} 2 evolve into quiescent galaxies in today's group

using spectroscopic redshifts from the DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey in
the range 0.42 in four independent fields. Using rest-frame U-B
color and [O II] equivalent widths, we distinguish star-forming from
passive populations in order to explore the nature of ‘‘downsizing''-a
pattern in which the sites of active star formation shift from high-mass
galaxies at early times to lower mass systems at later epochs. We
identify a mass limit, MQ, above which star formation appears
to be quenched and show that the physical mechanisms responsible for
downsizing can thus be empirically quantified by charting the evolution
in this threshold mass. We find that MQ decreases with time
by a factor of \textasciitilde{}3 across our redshift range according to
MQ\textasciitilde{}(1+z)3.5. To further constrain possible
quenching mechanisms, we investigate how downsizing depends on local
galaxy environment using the projected third-nearest-neighbor statistic
Dp,3. For the majority of galaxies near the median density,
there is no significant correlation between downsizing and environment.
However, a trend is observed in the comparison between environments that
are more than 3 times overdense or underdense relative to the median.
Here, downsizing appears accelerated in overdense regions that host
higher numbers of massive, early-type galaxies as compared to the

galaxies from the COMBO-17 survey over the interval 0.2 $<$ z $<$ 1.0.
We have developed, implemented, and tested a new method of estimating
stellar mass-to-light ratios, which relies on redshift and spectral
energy distribution (SED) classification from 5 broadband and 12 medium
band filters. We find that the majority ($>$60\%) of massive galaxies
with M* $>$ 1011 M$\odot$ at all z $<$
1 are non-star-forming; blue star-forming galaxies dominate at lower
masses. We have used these mass estimates to explore the evolution of
the stellar mass function since z =1. We find that the total stellar
mass density of the universe has roughly doubled since z \texttildelow{} 1. Our
measurements are consistent with other measurements of the growth of
stellar mass with cosmic time and with estimates of the time evolution
of the cosmic star formation rate. Intriguingly, the integrated stellar
mass of blue galaxies with young stars has not significantly changed
since z \texttildelow{} 1, even though these galaxies host the majority of the
star formation: instead, the growth of the total stellar mass density is
dominated by the growth of the total mass in the largely passive
galaxies on the red sequence.},

Here I explore the relative importance of these various effects, finding that mergers and other processes are unlikely to convert more than 10\% of the blue galaxy sequence into red galaxies in that time period. I compare the galaxy population at redshift z\textasciitilde{}0.1 from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to the sample at z\textasciitilde{}1 from the Deep Extragalactic Evolutionary Probe 2 (DEEP2). Galaxies are bluer at z\textasciitilde{}1: the blue sequence by about 0.3 mag and the red sequence by about 0.1 mag in 0.1(u-g). I evaluate the change in color and in the luminosity functions of the two sequences using some simplistic stellar population synthesis models. These models indicate that the luminous end of the red sequence fades less than passive evolution allows by about 0.2 mag. Due to a lack of luminous blue progenitors, ‘‘dry'' mergers between red galaxies then must create the luminous red population at z\textasciitilde{}0.1 if the stellar population models and flux estimates are correct. The blue-sequence colors and luminosity function are consistent with a reduction in the star formation rate since z\textasciitilde{}1 (by at least a factor of about 3, although this study does not constrain the exact number well), with no change in the number density to within 10\%. These results restrict the number of blue galaxies that can fall onto the red sequence by any process, and in particular suggest that if mergers are catastrophic events, they must be rare for blue galaxies.},

measurements, refining the results of numerous measurements over the past decade. The data show a compellingly consistent picture of the SFH out to redshift z\textasciitilde{}6, with especially tight constraints for z$<$\textasciitilde{}1. We fit these data with simple analytical forms and derive conservative uncertainties. Since the z$<$\textasciitilde{}1 SFH data are quite precise, we
investigate the sequence of assumptions and corrections that together affect the SFH normalization to test their accuracy, both in this redshift range and beyond. As lower limits on this normalization, we consider the evolution in stellar and metal mass densities, and
supernova rate density, finding it unlikely that the SFH normalization is much lower than indicated by our direct fit. As a corresponding upper limit on the SFH normalization, we consider the Super-Kamiokande limit on the electron antineutrino ($\nu$e) flux from past
core-collapse supernovae, which applies primarily to z$<$\textasciitilde{}1. We find consistency with the SFH only if the neutrino temperatures from
supernova events are relatively modest. Constraints on the assumed initial mass function (IMF) also become apparent. The traditional Salpeter IMF, assumed for convenience by many authors, is known to be a poor representation at low stellar masses ($<$\textasciitilde{}1 Msolar), and we show that recently favored IMFs are also constrained. In
particular, somewhat shallow, or top-heavy, IMFs may be preferred, although they cannot be too top-heavy. To resolve the outstanding issues, improved data are called for on the supernova rate density evolution, the ranges of stellar masses leading to core-collapse and type Ia supernovae, and the antineutrino and neutrino backgrounds from core-collapse supernovae.},

consider the effects of a wide range of uncertainties on our results,

function, halo mass accretion histories, and halo-subhalo merger rates
out to z = 8. We also provide new compilations of CSFRs and SSFRs; more
recent measurements are now consistent with the buildup of the cosmic
stellar mass density at all redshifts. Implications of our work include:
halos near 1012 M $\odot$ are the most efficient
at forming stars at all redshifts, the baryon conversion efficiency of
massive halos drops markedly after z \textasciitilde{} 2.5 (consistent with theories of
cold-mode accretion), the ICL for massive galaxies is expected to be
significant out to at least z \textasciitilde{} 1-1.5, and dwarf galaxies at low
redshifts have higher stellar mass to halo mass ratios than previous
expectations and form later than in most theoretical models. Finally, we
provide new fitting formulae for SFHs that are more accurate than the
standard declining tau model. Our approach places a wide variety of
observations relating to the SFH of galaxies into a self-consistent
framework based on the modern understanding of structure formation in
$\Lambda$CDM. Constraints on the stellar mass-halo mass relationship and

  abstract = {Over the past two decades, an avalanche of new data from multiwavelength imaging and spectroscopic surveys has revolutionized our view of galaxy formation and evolution. Here we review the range of complementary techniques and theoretical tools that allow astronomers to map the cosmic history of star formation, heavy element production, and
reionization of the Universe from the cosmic ``dark ages'' to
the present epoch. A consistent picture is emerging, whereby the star-formation rate density peaked approximately 3.5 Gyr after the Big Bang, at z$\approx$1.9, and declined exponentially at later times, with an e-folding timescale of 3.9 Gyr. Half of the stellar mass observed today was formed before a redshift z = 1.3. About 25\% formed before the peak of the cosmic star-formation rate density, and another 25\% formed after z = 0.7. Less than \texttildelow{}1\% of today's stars formed during the epoch of reionization. Under the assumption of a universal initial mass function, the global stellar mass density inferred at any epoch matches reasonably well the time integral of all the preceding star-formation activity. The comoving rates of star formation and central black hole accretion follow a similar rise and fall, offering evidence for coevolution of black holes and their host galaxies. The rise of the mean metallicity of the Universe to about 0.001 solar by z = 6, one Gyr after the Big Bang, appears to have been accompanied by the production of fewer than ten hydrogen Lyman-continuum photons per baryon, a rather tight budget for cosmological reionization.},

stronger evolution in the red fraction: f red(z) vprop (1 + z

series of sensitivity analyses, we show that the most important sources
of systematic error are (1) systematic differences in the analysis of
the z $\approx$ 0 and z Gt 0 samples; (2) systematic effects associated with
details of the photometric redshift calculation; and (3) uncertainties
in the photometric calibration. With this in mind, we show that our
results based on photometric redshifts are consistent with a completely
independent analysis which does not require redshift information for

Most methods fall into two broad groups: those that use nearest neighbours to probe the underlying density field and those that use fixed apertures. The differences between the two inhibit a clean comparison between analyses and leave open the possibility that, even with the same data, different properties are actually being measured. In this work, we apply 20 published environment definitions to a common mock galaxy catalogue constrained to look like the local Universe. We find that
nearest-neighbour-based measures best probe the internal densities of high-mass haloes, while at low masses the interhalo separation dominates and acts to smooth out local density variations. The resulting
correlation also shows that nearest-neighbour galaxy environment is largely independent of dark matter halo mass. Conversely, aperture-based methods that probe superhalo scales accurately identify high-density regions corresponding to high-mass haloes. Both methods show how galaxies in dense environments tend to be redder, with the exception of the largest apertures, but these are the strongest at recovering the background dark matter environment. We also warn against using
photometric redshifts to define environment in all but the densest regions. When considering environment, there are two regimes: the 'local environment' internal to a halo best measured with nearest neighbour and 'large-scale environment' external to a halo best measured with
apertures. This leads to the conclusion that there is no universal environment measure and the most suitable method depends on the scale being probed.},

We use high-resolution H I data from The H I Nearby Galaxy Survey, CO data from HERACLES and the BIMA Survey of Nearby Galaxies, 24 $\mu$m data from the Spitzer Space Telescope, and UV data from the Galaxy Evolution Explorer. We target seven spiral galaxies and 11 late-type/dwarf galaxies and investigate how the star formation law differs between the H2 dominated centers of spiral galaxies, their H I dominated outskirts and the H I rich late-type/dwarf galaxies. We find that a Schmidt-type power law with index N = 1.0 $\pm$ 0.2
relates $\Sigma$SFR and $\Sigma$H2 across our sample
of spiral galaxies, i.e., that H2 forms stars at a constant efficiency in spirals. The average molecular gas depletion time is \textasciitilde{}2 \texttimes{} 109 years. The range of $\Sigma$H2 over
which we measure this relation is \textasciitilde{}3-50 M sun
pc-2, significantly lower than in starburst environments. We find the same results when performing a pixel-by-pixel analysis, averaging in radial bins, or when varying the star formation tracer used. We interpret the linear relation and constant depletion time as evidence that stars are forming in giant molecular clouds with
approximately uniform properties and that $\Sigma$H2 may be
more a measure of the filling fraction of giant molecular clouds than changing conditions in the molecular gas. The relationship between total gas surface density ($\Sigma$gas) and $\Sigma$SFR
varies dramatically among and within spiral galaxies. Most galaxies show little or no correlation between $\Sigma$HI and
$\Sigma$SFR. As a result, the star formation efficiency (SFE), $\Sigma$SFR/$\Sigma$gas, varies strongly across our
sample and within individual galaxies. We show that this variation is systematic and consistent with the SFE being set by local environmental factors: in spirals the SFE is a clear function of radius, while the dwarf galaxies in our sample display SFEs similar to those found in the outer optical disks of the spirals. We attribute the similarity to common environments (low density, low metallicity, H I dominated) and argue that shear (which is typically absent in dwarfs) cannot drive the SFE. In addition to a molecular Schmidt law, the other general feature of our sample is a sharp saturation of H I surface densities at
$\Sigma$HI $\approx$ 9 M sun pc-2 in both the
spiral and dwarf galaxies. In the case of the spirals, we observe gas in excess of this limit to be molecular.},

Our stellar evolution and chemical enrichment scheme follows nine elements (H, He, C, N, O, Ne, Mg, Si, Fe) independently. Stellar feedback is realized through kinetic outflows. The metal mass loading of outflows can be adjusted independently of the wind mass loading. This is required to
simultaneously reproduce the stellar mass content of low-mass haloes and their gas oxygen abundances. Radiative EM AGN feedback is implemented assuming an average spectral energy distribution and a
luminosity-dependent scaling of obscuration effects. This form of feedback suppresses star formation more efficiently than continuous thermal quasar-mode feedback alone, but is less efficient than
mechanical radio-mode feedback in regulating star formation in massive haloes. We contrast simulation predictions for different variants of our galaxy formation model with key observations, allowing us to constrain the importance of different modes of feedback and their uncertain efficiency parameters. We identify a fiducial best match model and show that it reproduces, among other things, the cosmic star formation history, the stellar mass function, the stellar mass-halo mass relation, g-, r-, i- and z-band SDSS galaxy luminosity functions, and the
Tully-Fisher relation. We can achieve this success only if we invoke very strong forms of stellar and AGN feedback such that star formation is adequately reduced in both low- and high-mass systems. In particular, the strength of radio-mode feedback needs to be increased significantly compared to previous studies to suppress efficient cooling in massive, metal-enriched haloes.},

  abstract = {We present a model for star formation and supernova feedback that 
describes the multiphase structure of star-forming gas on scales that
are typically not resolved in cosmological simulations. Our approach
includes radiative heating and cooling, the growth of cold clouds
embedded in an ambient hot medium, star formation in these clouds,
feedback from supernovae in the form of thermal heating and cloud
evaporation, galactic winds and outflows, and metal enrichment.
Implemented using smoothed particle hydrodynamics, our scheme is a
significantly modified and extended version of the grid-based method of
Yepes et al., and enables us to achieve a high dynamic range in
simulations of structure formation.

We discuss properties of the feedback model in detail and show that it
predicts a self-regulated, quiescent mode of star formation, which, in
particular, stabilizes the star-forming gaseous layers of disc galaxies.
The parametrization of this mode can be reduced to a single free
quantity that determines the overall time-scale for star formation. We
fix this parameter numerically to match the observed rates of star
formation in local disc galaxies. When normalized in this manner,
cosmological simulations employing our model nevertheless overproduce
the observed cosmic abundance of stellar material. We are thus motivated
to extend our feedback model to include galactic winds associated with
star formation.

Using small-scale simulations of individual star-forming disc galaxies,
we show that these winds produce either galactic fountains or outflows,
depending on the depth of the gravitational potential. In low-mass
haloes, winds can greatly suppress the overall efficiency of star
formation. When incorporated into cosmological simulations, our combined
model for star formation and winds predicts a cosmic star formation
density that is consistent with observations, provided that the winds
are sufficiently energetic. Moreover, outflows from galaxies in these
simulations drive chemical enrichment of the intergalactic medium - in
principle, accounting for the presence of metals in the Lyman $\alpha$
forest.},

feedback processes that for the first time allows cosmological
simulations of structure formation to self-consistently follow the build
up of the cosmic population of galaxies and active galactic nuclei

cosmic epochs at the centres of forming haloes. We then track their
growth from gas accretion and mergers with other black holes in the
course of cosmic time. For black holes that are active, we distinguish
between two distinct modes of feedback, depending on the black hole
accretion rate itself. Black holes that accrete at high rates are
assumed to be in a ‘quasar regime', where we model their feedback by
thermally coupling a small fraction of their bolometric luminosity to
the surrounding gas. The quasar activity requires high densities of
relatively cold gas around the black hole, as it is achieved through
large-scale inflows triggered by galaxy mergers. For black holes with
low accretion rates, we conjecture that most of their feedback occurs in
mechanical form, where AGN-driven bubbles are injected into a gaseous
environment. This regime of activity, which is subdominant in terms of
total black hole mass growth, can be identified with radio galaxies in
clusters of galaxies, and can suppress cluster cooling flows without the
requirement of a triggering by mergers. Using our new model, we carry
out TREESPH cosmological simulations on the scales of individual
galaxies to those of massive galaxy clusters, both for isolated systems
and for cosmological boxes. We demonstrate that our model produces
results for the black hole and stellar mass densities in broad agreement
with observational constraints. We find that the black holes
significantly influence the evolution of their host galaxies, changing
their star formation history, their amount of cold gas and their
colours. Furthermore, the properties of intracluster gas are affected
strongly by the presence of massive black holes in the cores of galaxy
clusters, leading to shallower metallicity and entropy profiles, and to
a suppression of strong cooling flows. Our results support the notion
that AGNs are a key ingredient in cosmological structure formation. They
lead to a self-regulated growth of black holes and bring the simulated
properties of their host galaxies into much better agreement with
observations.},

challenge for galaxy formation models. In this paper, we study the tight
correlation between the star formation rate (SFR) and stellar mass of
galaxies at a given redshift, how halo growth influences star formation,
and star formation histories of individual galaxies. We study these
topics using Illustris, a state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamical
simulation of galaxy formation. Illustris reproduces the observed
relation (the star formation main sequence, SFMS) between SFR and
stellar mass at redshifts z = 0 and 4, but at intermediate redshifts of
z $\simeq$ 1-2, the simulated SFMS has a significantly lower normalization
than reported by observations. The scatter in the relation is consistent
with the observed scatter. However, the fraction of outliers above the
SFR-stellar mass relation in Illustris is less than that observed.
Galaxies with halo masses of \texttildelow{}1012 M$\odot$
dominate the SFR density of the Universe, in agreement with the results
of abundance matching. Furthermore, more-massive galaxies tend to form
the bulk of their stars at high redshift, which indicates that
‘downsizing' occurs in Illustris. We also studied the star formation
histories of individual galaxies, including the use of a principal
component analysis decomposition. We find that for fixed stellar mass,
galaxies that form earlier have more-massive black holes at z = 0,
indicating that star formation and black hole growth are tightly linked
processes in Illustris. While many of the properties of normal
star-forming galaxies are well reproduced in the Illustris simulation,
forming a realistic population of starbursts will likely require higher
resolution and probably a more sophisticated treatment of star formation
and feedback from stars and black holes.},

framework where the gradual suppression of a galaxy's star

heating. From this framework, it follows that at least some galaxies
with intermediate specific black hole masses are in a steady state of
partial quiescence with intermediate specific SFRs, implying that both

and their Environments (EAGLE) project, a suite of hydrodynamical
simulations that follow the formation of galaxies and supermassive black
holes in cosmologically representative volumes of a standard $\Lambda$
cold dark matter universe. We discuss the limitations of such
simulations in light of their finite resolution and poorly constrained
subgrid physics, and how these affect their predictive power. One major
improvement is our treatment of feedback from massive stars and active
galactic nuclei (AGN) in which thermal energy is injected into the gas
without the need to turn off cooling or decouple hydrodynamical forces,
allowing winds to develop without predetermined speed or mass loading
factors. Because the feedback efficiencies cannot be predicted from
first principles, we calibrate them to the present-day galaxy stellar
mass function and the amplitude of the galaxy-central black hole mass
relation, also taking galaxy sizes into account. The observed galaxy
stellar mass function is reproduced to $\lessequivlnt$ 0.2 dex over the full
resolved mass range, 108 $<$ M*/M$\odot$
$\lessequivlnt$ 1011, a level of agreement close to that attained by
semi-analytic models, and unprecedented for hydrodynamical simulations.
We compare our results to a representative set of low-redshift
observables not considered in the calibration, and find good agreement
with the observed galaxy specific star formation rates, passive
fractions, Tully-Fisher relation, total stellar luminosities of galaxy
clusters, and column density distributions of intergalactic C IV and O
VI. While the mass-metallicity relations for gas and stars are
consistent with observations for M* $\greaterequivlnt$ 109
M$\odot$ (M* $\greaterequivlnt$ 1010
M$\odot$ at intermediate resolution), they are insufficiently
steep at lower masses. For the reference model, the gas fractions and
temperatures are too high for clusters of galaxies, but for galaxy
groups these discrepancies can be resolved by adopting a higher heating
temperature in the subgrid prescription for AGN feedback. The EAGLE
simulation suite, which also includes physics variations and higher
resolution zoomed-in volumes described elsewhere, constitutes a valuable
new resource for studies of galaxy formation.},

the evolution of a periodic cube L = 50 cMpc on a side, and each employs
a different subgrid model of the energetic feedback associated with star
formation. The relevant parameters were adjusted so that the simulations
each reproduce the observed galaxy stellar mass function at z = 0.1.
Three of the simulations fail to form disc galaxies as extended as
observed, and we show analytically that this is a consequence of
numerical radiative losses that reduce the efficiency of stellar
feedback in high-density gas. Such losses are greatly reduced in the
fourth simulation - the EAGLE reference model - by injecting more energy
in higher density gas. This model produces galaxies with the observed
size distribution, and also reproduces many galaxy scaling relations. In
the remaining nine simulations, a single parameter or process of the
reference model was varied at a time. We find that the properties of
galaxies with stellar mass $\lessequivlnt$ M$\star$ (the ‘knee' of the
galaxy stellar mass function) are largely governed by feedback
associated with star formation, while those of more massive galaxies are
also controlled by feedback from accretion on to their central black
holes. Both processes must be efficient in order to reproduce the
observed galaxy population. In general, simulations that have been
calibrated to reproduce the low-redshift galaxy stellar mass function
will still not form realistic galaxies, but the additional requirement

We argue that the main cause of the catastrophic cooling is a mismatch between the mass of the gas in which the energy is injected and the mass of the parent stellar
population. Because too much mass is heated, the temperatures are too low and the cooling times too short. We use analytic arguments to estimate, as a function of the gas density and the numerical resolution, the minimum heating temperature that is required for the injected thermal energy to be efficiently converted into kinetic energy. We then propose and test a stochastic implementation of thermal feedback that uses this minimum temperature increase as an input parameter and that can be employed in both particle-based and grid-based codes. We use smoothed particle hydrodynamic simulations to test the method on models of isolated disc galaxies in dark matter haloes with total mass
1010 and 1012 h-1 M$\odot$. The thermal feedback strongly suppresses the star formation rate and can drive massive, large-scale outflows without the need to turn off radiative cooling temporarily. In accordance with expectations derived from analytic arguments, for sufficiently high resolution the results become insensitive to the imposed temperature jump and also agree with high-resolution simulations employing kinetic feedback.},

Luminosity
functions from ultraviolet to near-infrared wavelengths differ from observations at a level comparable to systematic shifts resulting from a choice between Petrosian and Kron photometric apertures. Despite the generally good agreement there are clear discrepancies with

Also, the spectra are distributed on the stellar evolutionary tracks using optical/near-infrared color
calibrations, as an improvement over models that used a single color of the effective temperature of the stars alone.

  abstract = {We present a new model for computing the effects of dust on the integrated spectral properties of galaxies, based on an idealized description of the main features of the interstellar medium (ISM). The model includes the ionization of H II regions in the interiors of the dense clouds in which stars form and the influence of the finite lifetime of these clouds on the absorption of radiation. We compute the production of emission lines and the absorption of continuum radiation in the H II regions and the subsequent transfer of line and continuum radiation in the surrounding H I regions and the ambient ISM. This enables us to interpret simultaneously all the observations of an ultraviolet-selected sample of nearby starburst galaxies, including the ratio of far-infrared to ultraviolet luminosities, the ratio of H$\alpha$ to H$\beta$ luminosities, the H$\alpha$ equivalent width, and the
ultraviolet spectral slope. We show that the finite lifetime of stellar birth clouds is a key ingredient for resolving an apparent discrepancy between the attenuation of line and continuum photons in starburst galaxies. In addition, we find that an effective absorption curve proportional to $\lambda$-0.7 reproduces the observed relation between the ratio of far-infrared to ultraviolet luminosities and the ultraviolet spectral slope. We interpret this relation most simply as a sequence in the overall dust content of the galaxies. The shallow wavelength dependence of the effective absorption curve is compatible with the steepness of known extinction curves if the dust has a patchy distribution. In particular, we find that a random distribution of discrete clouds with optical depths similar to those in the Milky Way provides a consistent interpretation of all the observations. A
noteworthy outcome of our detailed analysis is that the observed mean relations for starburst galaxies can be closely approximated by the following simple recipe: use an effective absorption curve proportional to $\lambda$-0.7 to attenuate the line and continuum radiation from each stellar generation, and lower the normalization of the curve, typically by a factor of 3 after 107 yr, to account for the dispersal of the birth clouds. This recipe or our full model for absorption can be incorporated easily into any population synthesis model.},

We extend these to include ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). The MHD equations are second-order consistent and conservative. We augment these with a divergence-cleaning scheme, which maintains nabla $\backslash$cdot

with state-of-the-art SPH MHD. We consider a large test suite, and show that on all problems the new methods are competitive with AMR using constrained transport (CT) to ensure nabla $\backslash$cdot B=0. They
correctly capture the growth/structure of the magnetorotational
instability, MHD turbulence, and launching of magnetic jets, in some cases converging more rapidly than state-of-the-art AMR. Compared to SPH, the MFM/MFV methods exhibit convergence at fixed neighbour number, sharp shock-capturing, and dramatically reduced noise, divergence errors, and diffusion. Still, ‘modern' SPH can handle most test
problems, at the cost of larger kernels and ‘by hand' adjustment of artificial diffusion. Compared to non-moving meshes, the new methods exhibit enhanced ‘grid noise' but reduced advection errors and
diffusion, easily include self-gravity, and feature velocity-independent errors and superior angular momentum conservation. They converge more slowly on some problems (smooth, slow-moving flows), but more rapidly on others (involving advection/rotation). In all cases, we show divergence control beyond the Powell 8-wave approach is necessary, or all methods can converge to unphysical answers even at high resolution.},

A realistic treatment of star formation in simulations and analytic models of galaxies therefore requires that one determine where the transition from the atomic to molecular gas occurs. In this paper, we compare two methods for making this determination in cosmological simulations where the internal structures of molecular clouds are unresolved: a complex time-dependent chemistry network coupled to a radiative transfer calculation of the dissociating ultraviolet (UV) radiation field and a simple time-independent analytic approximation. We show that these two methods produce excellent agreement at all metallicities
gsim10-2 of the Milky Way value across a very wide range of UV fields. At lower metallicities the agreement is worse, likely because time-dependent effects become important; however, there are no
observational calibrations of molecular gas content at such low
metallicities, so it is unclear if either method is accurate. The comparison suggests that, in many but not all applications, the analytic approximation provides a viable and nearly cost-free alternative to full time-dependent chemistry and radiative transfer.},

Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE) simulations. This suite of
hydrodynamic cosmological zoom simulations resolves formation of
star-forming giant molecular clouds to z = 0, and features an explicit
stellar feedback model on small scales. Our simulations reveal that
high-redshift galaxies undergo bursts of star formation followed by
powerful gusts of galactic outflows that eject much of the interstellar
medium and temporarily suppress star formation. At low redshift,
however, sufficiently massive galaxies corresponding to L* progenitors
develop stable discs and switch into a continuous and quiescent mode of
star formation that does not drive outflows far into the halo.
Mass-loading factors for winds in L* progenitors are $\eta$ $\approx$ 10 at
high redshift, but decrease to $\eta$ $\ll$ 1 at low redshift. Although
lower values of $\eta$ are expected as haloes grow in mass over time, we
show that the strong suppression of outflows with decreasing redshift
cannot be explained by mass evolution alone. Circumgalactic outflow
velocities are variable and broadly distributed, but typically range
between one and three times the circular velocity of the halo. Much of
the ejected material builds a reservoir of enriched gas within the
circumgalactic medium, some of which could be later recycled to fuel
further star formation. However, a fraction of the gas that leaves the
virial radius through galactic winds is never regained, causing most
haloes with mass Mh $\leq$ 1012 M$\odot$ to
be deficient in baryons compared to the cosmic mean by z = 0.},

These simulations reproduce a broad range of locally observed trends among quenching, halo mass, stellar mass, environment, and distance to halo centre. Mass quenching is independent of environment because
\texttildelow{}1012-1013 M$\odot$ ‘mass quenching
haloes' inhabit a large range of environments. On the other hand, environment quenching is independent of stellar mass because galaxies of all stellar masses may live in dense environments as satellites of groups and clusters. As in observations, the quenched fraction of satellites increases with halo mass and decreases with distance to the centre of the group or cluster. We investigate pre-processing in group haloes, ejected former satellites, and hot gas that extends beyond the virial radius. The agreement of our model with key observational trends suggests that hot gas in massive haloes plays a leading role in

  abstract = {Galaxies strongly self-regulate their growth via energetic feedback from stars, supernovae, and black holes, but these processes are among the least understood aspects of galaxy formation theory. We present an analytic galaxy evolution model that directly constrains such feedback processes from observed galaxy scaling relations. The equilibrium model, which is broadly valid for star-forming central galaxies that dominate cosmic star formation, is based on the ansatz that galaxies live in a slowly evolving equilibrium between inflows, outflows, and star
formation. Using a Bayesian Monte Carlo Markov chain approach, we constrain our model to match observed galaxy scaling relations between stellar mass and halo mass, star formation rate, and metallicity from 0 $<$ z $<$ 2. A good fit ($\chi$2 $\approx$ 1.6) is achieved with
eight free parameters. We further show that constraining our model to any two of the three data sets also produces a fit to the third that is within reasonable systematic uncertainties. The resulting best-fitting parameters that describe baryon cycling suggest galactic outflow scalings intermediate between energy and momentum-driven winds, a weak dependence of wind recycling time on mass, and a quenching mass scale that evolves modestly upwards with redshift. This model further predicts a stellar mass-star formation rate relation that is in good agreement with observations to z \texttildelow{} 6. Our results suggest that this simple analytic framework captures the basic physical processes required to model the mean evolution of stars and metals in galaxies, despite not incorporating many canonical ingredients of galaxy formation models such as merging or disc formation.},

  abstract = {We investigate galaxy conformity using the MUFASA cosmological hydrodynamical simulation. We show a bimodal distribution in galaxy colour with radius, albeit with too many low-mass quenched satellite galaxies compared to observations. MUFASA produces conformity in observed properties such as colour, specific star formation rate (sSFR), and H I content, i.e. neighbouring galaxies have similar properties. We see analogous trends in other properties such as in environment, stellar age, H2 content, and metallicity. We introduce quantifying conformity using S(R), measuring the relative difference in upper and lower quartile properties of the neighbours. We show that low-mass and non-quenched haloes have weak conformity (S(R)$\lessequivlnt$ 0.5) extending to large projected radii R in all properties, while high-mass and quenched haloes have strong conformity (S(R)\texttildelow{} 1) that diminishes rapidly
with R and disappears at R $\greaterequivlnt$ 1 Mpc. S(R) is strongest for
environment in low-mass haloes, and sSFR (or colour) in high-mass haloes, and is dominated by one-halo conformity with the exception of H I in small haloes. Metallicity shows a curious anticonformity in massive haloes. Tracking the evolution of conformity for z = 0 galaxies back in time shows that conformity broadly emerges as a late-time (z $\lessequivlnt$ 1) phenomenon. However, for fixed halo mass bins, conformity is fairly constant with redshift out to z $\greaterequivlnt$ 2. These trends are consistent with the idea that strong conformity only emerges once haloes grow above MUFASA's quenching mass scale of \texttildelow{}1012
M$\odot$. A quantitative measure of conformity in various
properties, along with its evolution, thus represents a new and
stringent test of the impact of quenching on environment within current galaxy formation models.},

We consider a ‘collisional starburst' model in which bursts of star formation are triggered by galaxy-galaxy mergers, and find that a significant fraction of LBGs are predicted to be starbursts. This model reproduces the observed comoving number density of bright LBGs as a function of redshift and the observed luminosity function at z\texttildelow{} 3 and z\texttildelow{} 4, with a reasonable amount of dust extinction. Model
galaxies at z\texttildelow{} 3 have star formation rates, half-light radii, I-K colours and internal velocity dispersions that are in good agreement with the data. Global quantities such as the star formation rate density and cold gas and metal content of the Universe as a function of redshift also agree well. Two ‘quiescent' models without starbursts are also investigated. In one, the star formation efficiency in galaxies remains constant with redshift, while in the other, it scales inversely with disc dynamical time, and thus increases rapidly with redshift. The first quiescent model is strongly ruled out, as it does not produce enough high-redshift galaxies once realistic dust extinction is accounted for. The second quiescent model fits marginally, but underproduces cold gas and very bright galaxies at high redshift. A general conclusion is that star formation at high redshift must be more efficient than locally. The collisional starburst model appears to accomplish this naturally without violating other observational constraints.},

Using a sample of nearby disk-dominated galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and high-redshift data from the GEMS (Galaxy Evolution from Morphology and SEDs) survey, we investigate whether this result is consistent with theoretical expectations within the hierarchical paradigm of structure formation. The relationship between virial radius and mass for dark matter halos in the $\Lambda$CDM model evolves by about a factor of 2 over this interval. However, N-body simulations have shown that halos of a given mass have less centrally concentrated mass profiles at high redshift. When we compute the expected disk size-stellar mass distribution, accounting for this evolution in the internal structure of dark matter halos and the adiabatic contraction of the dark matter by the self-gravity of the collapsing baryons, we find that the predicted evolution in the mean size at fixed stellar mass since z \textasciitilde{} 1 is about 15\%-20\%, in good agreement with the observational constraints from GEMS. At redshift z \textasciitilde{} 2, the model predicts that disks at fixed stellar mass were on average only 60\% as large as they are today. Similarly, we predict that the rotation velocity at a given stellar mass (essentially the zero point of the Tully-Fisher relation) is only about 10\% larger at z \textasciitilde{} 1 (20\% at z \textasciitilde{} 2) than at the present day.},

the context of the Lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmological

regulates the growth of the black holes themselves, drives galactic
scale winds that can remove cold gas from galaxies, and produces
powerful jets that heat the hot gas atmospheres surrounding groups and
clusters. We present a comprehensive comparison of our model predictions
with observational measurements of key physical properties of
low-redshift galaxies, such as cold gas fractions, stellar metallicities

successfully reproduce the exponential cut-off in the stellar mass

predict that star formation should be largely, but not entirely,
quenched in massive galaxies at the present day. We also find that our
model of self-regulated BH growth naturally reproduces the observed
relation between BH mass and bulge mass. We explore the global formation
history of galaxies and black holes in our models, presenting
predictions for the cosmic histories of star formation, stellar mass
assembly, cold gas and metals. We find that models assuming the
‘concordance' $\Lambda$CDM cosmology overproduce star formation and
stellar mass at high redshift (z $>$\textasciitilde{} 2). A model with less small-scale

Spheroids also form earlier in models with spheroid growth via disc instabilities. Our model correctly predicts the normalization, slope, and scatter of the low-redshift size-mass and Fundamental Plane relations for early-type galaxies.

The model also correctly predicts the observed strong evolution of the size-mass relation for spheroids out to higher redshifts, as well as the slower evolution in the normalization of the Faber-Jackson relation. We emphasize that these are genuine predictions of the model since it was tuned to match hydrodynamical simulations and not these observations.},

We find that both recipes successfully reproduce the gas fractions and gas-to-stellar mass ratios of H I and H2 in local galaxies, as well as the H I and H2 disc sizes up to z $\leq$ 2. We reach good agreement with the locally observed H I and H2 mass function, although both recipes slightly overpredict the low-mass end of the H I mass function. Both of our models predict that the high-mass end of the H I mass function remains nearly constant at redshifts z $<$ 2.0. The
metallicity-based recipe yields a higher cosmic density of cold gas and much lower cosmic H2 fraction over the entire redshift range probed than the pressure-based recipe. These strong differences in H I mass function and cosmic density between the two recipes are driven by low-mass galaxies (log (M*/M$\odot$) $\leq$ 7)
residing in low-mass haloes (log (Mvir/M$\odot$) $\leq$ 10). Both recipes predict that galaxy gas fractions remain high from z \texttildelow{} 6to3 and drop rapidly at lower redshift. The galaxy
H2 fractions show a similar trend, but drop even more rapidly. We provide predictions for the CO J = 1-0 luminosity of galaxies, which will be directly comparable with observations with sub-mm and radio instruments.},

We present results of the model based on realistic cosmological simulations of high-z galaxy formation for a grid of numerical models with varied dust-to-gas ratios and interstellar far-UV (FUV) fluxes. Our results show that both the atomic-to-molecular transition on small,
tens-of-parsec scales and the Kennicutt-Schmidt (K-S) relation on large, kiloparsec scales are sensitive to the dust-to-gas ratio and the FUV flux. The atomic-to-molecular transition as a function of gas density or column density has a large scatter but is rather sharp and shifts to higher densities with decreasing dust-to-gas ratio and/or increasing FUV flux. Consequently, star formation is concentrated to higher gas surface density regions, resulting in steeper slope and lower amplitude of the K-S relation at a given $\Sigma$H, in less dusty and/or higher FUV flux environments. We parameterize the dependences observed in our simulations in convenient fitting formulae, which can be used to model the dependence of the K-S relation on the dust-to-gas ratio and FUV flux in semi-analytic models and in cosmological simulations that do not include radiative transfer and H2 formation.

Here we review the current status of models that employ two leading techniques to simulate the physics of galaxy formation: semianalytic models and numerical hydrodynamic simulations. We focus on a set of observational targets that describe the evolution of the global and structural properties of galaxies from roughly cosmic high noon (z \^a\textonequarter{} 2-3) to the
present. Although minor discrepancies remain, overall, models show remarkable convergence among different methods and make predictions that are in qualitative agreement with observations. Modelers have converged on a core set of physical processes that are critical for shaping galaxy properties. This core set includes cosmological accretion, strong stellar-driven winds that are more efficient at low masses, black hole feedback that preferentially suppresses star formation at high masses, and structural and morphological evolution through merging and
environmental processes. However, all cosmological models currently adopt phenomenological implementations of many of these core processes, which must be tuned to observations. Many details of how these diverse processes interact within a hierarchical structure formation setting remain poorly understood. Emerging multiscale simulations are helping to bridge the gap between stellar and cosmological scales, placing models on a firmer, more physically grounded footing. Concurrently, upcoming telescope facilities will provide new challenges and constraints for models, particularly by directly constraining inflows and outflows through observations of gas in and around galaxies.},

We compare the observed fractions with predictions from a semi-analytic model which includes prescriptions for bulge growth and AGN feedback due to mergers and disc instabilities. We facilitate direct morphological comparison by
converting our model bulge-to-total stellar mass ratios to S\'ersic indices. We then subdivide our population into the four quadrants of the specific star formation rate-S\'ersic index plane and study the
build-up of each of these subpopulations. We find that the fraction of star-forming discs declines steadily, while the fraction of quiescent spheroids builds up over cosmic time. The fractions of star-forming spheroids and quiescent discs are both non-negligible, and stay nearly constant over the period we have studied. Our model is qualitatively successful at reproducing the evolution of the two ‘main' populations (star-forming discs and quiescent spheroids), and approximately
reproduces the relative fractions of all four types, but predicts a stronger decline in star-forming spheroids, and increase in quiescent discs, than is seen in the observations. A model with an additional channel for bulge growth via disc instabilities agrees better overall with the observations than a model in which bulges can grow only through mergers.

redshift-dependent main sequence and examine the medians of these

move from galaxies above the SFMS to those below it, we see a nearly
monotonic trend towards higher median S\'ersic index, smaller

growth is driven by mergers and disc instabilities, and is accompanied
by the growth of a supermassive black hole which can regulate or quench

might transition between the 'star-forming main sequence' (SFMS) and
varying 'degrees of quiescence' out to z = 3. Our analysis is focused on
galaxies with stellar mass M* $>$ 1010
M$\odot$, and is enabled by GAMA and CANDELS observations, a
semi-analytic model (SAM) of galaxy formation, and a cosmological
hydrodynamical 'zoom in' simulation with momentum-driven AGN feedback.
In both the observations and the SAM, transition galaxies tend to have
intermediate S\'ersic indices, half-light radii, and surface
stellar mass densities compared to star-forming and quiescent galaxies
out to z = 3. We place an observational upper limit on the average
population transition time-scale as a function of redshift, finding that
the average high-redshift galaxy is on a 'fast track' for quenching
whereas the average low-redshift galaxy is on a 'slow track' for
quenching. We qualitatively identify four physical origin scenarios for
transition galaxies in the SAM: oscillations on the SFMS, slow
quenching, fast quenching, and rejuvenation. Quenching time-scales in
both the SAM and the hydrodynamical simulation are not fast enough to
reproduce the quiescent population that we observe at z $\sim$ 3. In the
SAM, we do not find a clear-cut morphological dependence of quenching
time-scales, but we do predict that the mean stellar ages, cold gas
fractions, SMBH (supermassive black hole) masses and halo masses of
transition galaxies tend to be intermediate relative to those of
star-forming and quiescent galaxies at z $<$ 3.},

these H I-deficient galaxies appear to lie significantly further away

Specifically, we find that approximately half of the galaxies with current cluster-centric distance in the interval 1-2 virial radii of the host are backsplash galaxies that once penetrated deep into the cluster potential, with 90 per cent of these entering to within 50 per cent of the virial radius. These galaxies have undergone significant tidal disruption, losing on average 40 per cent of their mass. This results in a mass function for the backsplash
population different from those galaxies infalling for the first time. We further show that these two populations are kinematically distinct and should be observable within existent spectroscopic surveys.},

The number of subhaloes ejected from a host of given mass increases with
the assembly redshift of the host. Ejected subhaloes in general reside

normal haloes of the same mass. They also have earlier assembly times,
so that they contribute to the assembly bias of dark matter haloes seen

  abstract = {Context. Groups of galaxies are a common environment, bridging the gap 
between starforming field galaxies and quiescent cluster galaxies.
Within groups secular processes could be at play, contributing to the
observed strong decrease of star formation with cosmic time in the
global galaxy population. Aims: We took advantage of the wealth
of information provided by the first 10 000 galaxies of the
zCOSMOS-bright survey and its group catalogue to study in detail the
complex interplay between group environment and galaxy properties. Methods: The classical indicator Fblue, i.e., the fraction
of blue galaxies, proved to be a simple but powerful diagnostic tool. We
studied its variation for different luminosity and mass selected galaxy
samples, divided as to define groups/field/isolated galaxy subsamples.
 Results: Using rest-frame evolving B-band volume-limited samples,
the groups galaxy population exhibits significant blueing as redshift
increases, but maintains a systematic difference (a lower
Fblue) with respect to the global galaxy population, and an
even larger difference with respect to the isolated galaxy population.
However moving to mass selected samples it becomes apparent that such
differences are largely due to the biased view imposed by the B-band
luminosity selection, being driven by the population of lower mass,
bright blue galaxies for which we miss the redder, equally low mass,
counterparts. By carefully focusing the analysis on narrow mass bins
such that mass segregation becomes negligible we find that only for the
lowest mass bin explored, i.e., log (\{$\backslash$cal M\}*/\{$\backslash$cal
M\}$\odot$) $\leq$ 10.6 , does a significant residual difference
in color remain as a function of environment, while this difference
becomes negligible toward higher masses. Conclusions: Our results
indicate that red galaxies of mass log (\{$\backslash$cal M\}*/\{$\backslash$cal
M\}$\odot$) $\geq$ 10.8 are already in place at z 1 and do not
exhibit any strong environmental dependence, possibly originating from
so-called nature or internal mechanisms. In contrast, for lower galaxy
masses and redshifts lower than z 1, we observe the emergence in
groups of a population of nurture red galaxies: slightly deviating from
the trend of the downsizing scenario followed by the global galaxy
population, and more so with cosmic time. These galaxies exhibit
signatures of group-related secular physical mechanisms directly
influencing galaxy evolution. Our analysis implies that these mechanisms
begin to significantly influence galaxy evolution after z 1, a
redshift corresponding to the emergence of structures in which these
mechanisms take place.

deg2 COSMOS field. The average star formation rate (SFR) for subsets of these galaxies is estimated with stacked 1.4 GHz radio continuum emission. We separately consider the total sample and a subset of galaxies that shows evidence for substantive recent star formation in the rest-frame optical spectral energy distributions. At redshifts 0.2 $<$ z $<$ 3 both populations show a strong and mass-independent
decrease in their SSFR toward the present epoch. It is best described by a power law (1 + z) n , where n \textasciitilde{} 4.3 for all galaxies and n \textasciitilde{} 3.5 for star-forming (SF) sources. The decrease appears to have started at z$>$2, at least for high-mass (M * $>$\textasciitilde{} 4
\texttimes{} 1010 M sun) systems where our conclusions are most robust. Our data show that there is a tight correlation with power-law dependence, SSFR vprop M * $\beta$,
between SSFR and stellar mass at all epochs. The relation tends to flatten below M * $\approx$ 1010 M sun if quiescent galaxies are included; if they are excluded from the analysis a shallow index $\beta$SFG $\approx$ -0.4 fits the correlation. On
average, higher mass objects always have lower SSFRs, also among SF galaxies. At z$>$1.5 there is tentative evidence for an upper threshold in SSFR that an average galaxy cannot exceed, possibly due to
gravitationally limited molecular gas accretion. It is suggested by a flattening of the SSFR-M * relation (also for SF sources), but affects massive ($>$1010 M sun) galaxies only at the highest redshifts. Since z = 1.5 there thus is no direct evidence that galaxies of higher mass experience a more rapid waning of their SSFR than lower mass SF systems. In this sense, the data rule out any strong "downsizing" in the SSFR. We combine our results with recent measurements of the galaxy (stellar) mass function in order to determine the characteristic mass of an SF galaxy: we find that since z \textasciitilde{} 3 the majority of all new stars were always formed in galaxies of M
* = 1010.6$\pm$0.4 M sun. In this
sense, too, there is no "downsizing." Finally, our analysis constitutes the most extensive SFR density determination with a single technique out to z = 3. Recent Herschel results are consistent with our results, but rely on far smaller samples.},

  abstract = {The red sequence is an important feature of galaxy clusters and plays a 
crucial role in optical cluster detection. Measurement of the slope and
scatter of the red sequence are affected both by selection of red
sequence galaxies and measurement errors. In this paper, we describe a
new error-corrected Gaussian Mixture Model for red sequence galaxy
identification. Using this technique, we can remove the effects of
measurement error and extract unbiased information about the intrinsic
properties of the red sequence. We use this method to select red
sequence galaxies in each of the 13,823 clusters in the maxBCG catalog,
and measure the red sequence ridgeline location and scatter of each.
These measurements provide precise constraints on the variation of the
average red galaxy populations in the observed frame with redshift. We
find that the scatter of the red sequence ridgeline increases mildly
with redshift, and that the slope decreases with redshift. We also
observe that the slope does not strongly depend on cluster richness.
Using similar methods, we show that this behavior is mirrored in a
spectroscopic sample of field galaxies, further emphasizing that
ridgeline properties are independent of environment. These precise
measurements serve as an important observational check on simulations
and mock galaxy catalogs. The observed trends in the slope and scatter
of the red sequence ridgeline with redshift are clues to possible
intrinsic evolution of the cluster red sequence itself. Most
importantly, the methods presented in this work lay the groundwork for
further improvements in optically based cluster cosmology.},

  abstract = {In our modern understanding of galaxy formation, every galaxy forms within a dark matter halo. The formation and growth of galaxies over time is connected to the growth of the halos in which they form. The advent of large galaxy surveys as well as high-resolution cosmological simulations has provided a new window into the statistical relationship between galaxies and halos and its evolution. Here we define this galaxy-halo connection as the multi-variate distribution of galaxy and halo properties that can be derived from observations and simulations. This connection provides a key test of physical galaxy formation models; it also plays an essential role in constraints of cosmological models using galaxy surveys and in elucidating the properties of dark matter using galaxies. We review techniques for inferring the galaxy-halo connection and the insights that have arisen from these approaches. Some things we have learned are that galaxy formation efficiency is a strong function of halo mass; at its peak in halos around a pivot halo mass of 10\^12 Msun, less than 20\% of the available baryons have turned into stars by the present day; the intrinsic scatter in galaxy stellar mass is small, less than 0.2 dex at a given halo mass above this pivot mass; below this pivot mass galaxy stellar mass is a strong function of halo mass; the majority of stars over cosmic time were formed in a narrow region around this pivot mass. We also highlight key open questions about how galaxies and halos are connected, including understanding the correlations with secondary properties and the connection of these properties to galaxy clustering.},

parametrizations derived from observations of local starburst galaxies,
in particular momentum-driven wind scenarios, provide the best agreement
with observations of CIV absorption at z \textasciitilde{} 2-5. Such models sufficiently
enrich the high-z IGM to produce a global mass density of CIV absorbers
that is relatively invariant from z = 5.5 -$>$ 1.5, in agreement with
observations. This occurs despite continual IGM enrichment causing an
increase in volume-averaged metallicity by \textasciitilde{} \texttimes{} 5-10 over this
redshift range, because energy input accompanying the enriching outflows
causes a drop in the global ionization fraction of CIV. Comparisons to
observed CIV column density and linewidth distributions and CIV-based
pixel optical depth ratios provide significant constraints on wind
models. Our best-fitting outflow models show mean IGM temperatures only
slightly above our no-outflow case, metal filling factors of just a few
per cent with volume-weighted metallicities around 10-3 at z
\textasciitilde{} 3, significant amounts of collisionally ionized CIV absorption and a
metallicity-density relationship that rises rapidly at low overdensities
and flattens at higher ones. In general, we find that outflow speeds
must be high enough to enrich the low-density IGM at early times but low
enough not to overheat it, and concurrently must significantly suppress
early star formation while still producing enough early metals. It is
therefore non-trivial that locally calibrated momentum-driven wind
scenarios naturally yield the desired strength and evolution of
outflows, and suggest that such models represent a significant step
towards understanding the impact of galactic outflows on galaxies and
the IGM across cosmic time.},

  abstract = {We present a method to flexibly and self-consistently determine individual galaxies' star formation rates (SFRs) from their host haloes' potential well depths, assembly histories, and redshifts. The method is constrained by galaxies' observed stellar mass functions, SFRs (specific and cosmic), quenched fractions, UV luminosity functions, UV-stellar mass relations, autocorrelation functions (including quenched and star-forming subsamples), and quenching dependence on environment; each observable is reproduced over the full redshift range available, up to 0$<$z$<$10. Key findings include: galaxy assembly correlates strongly with halo assembly; quenching at z$>$1 correlates strongly with halo mass; quenched fractions at fixed halo mass decrease with increasing redshift; massive quenched galaxies reside in higher-mass haloes than star-forming galaxies at fixed galaxy mass; star-forming and quenched galaxies' star formation histories at fixed mass differ most at z$<$0.5; satellites have large scatter in quenching timescales after infall, and have modestly higher quenched fractions than central galaxies; Planck cosmologies result in up to 0.3 dex lower stellar mass-halo mass ratios at early times; and, nonetheless, stellar mass-halo mass ratios rise at z$>$5. Also presented are revised stellar mass-halo mass relations for all, quenched, star-forming, central, and satellite galaxies; the dependence of star formation histories on halo mass, stellar mass, and galaxy SSFR; quenched fractions and quenching timescale distributions for satellites; and predictions for higher-redshift galaxy correlation functions and weak lensing surface densities. The public data release includes the massively parallel ($>$10\^5 cores) implementation (the UniverseMachine), the newly compiled and remeasured observational data, derived galaxy formation constraints, and mock catalogs including lightcones.},

  abstract = {We present new constraints on the relationship between galaxies and 
their host dark matter haloes, measured from the location of the peak of
the stellar-to-halo mass ratio (SHMR), up to the most massive galaxy
clusters at redshift z \texttildelow{} 0.8 and over a volume of nearly 0.1
Gpc3. We use a unique combination of deep observations in the
CFHTLenS/VIPERS field from the near-UV to the near-IR, supplemented by
\texttildelow{}60 000 secure spectroscopic redshifts, analysing galaxy
clustering, galaxy-galaxy lensing and the stellar mass function. We
interpret our measurements within the halo occupation distribution (HOD)
framework, separating the contributions from central and satellite
galaxies. We find that the SHMR for the central galaxies peaks at M\_\{h,
peak\} = 1.9\^\{+0.2\}\_\{-0.1\}\texttimes{} 10\^\{12\} M\_\{$\odot$\} with an amplitude of
0.025, which decreases to \texttildelow{}0.001 for massive haloes (\{\{\{M\}\_h\}\}$>$
10\^\{14\} M\_\{$\odot$\}). Compared to central galaxies only, the total SHMR
(including satellites) is boosted by a factor of 10 in the high-mass
regime (cluster-size haloes), a result consistent with cluster analyses
from the literature based on fully independent methods. After properly
accounting for differences in modelling, we have compared our results
with a large number of results from the literature up to z = 1: we find
good general agreement, independently of the method used, within the
typical stellar-mass systematic errors at low to intermediate mass
(M\_\{star\}$<$10\^\{11\} M\_\{$\odot$\}) and the statistical errors above. We
have also compared our SHMR results to semi-analytic simulations and
found that the SHMR is tilted compared to our measurements in such a way
that they over- (under-) predict star formation efficiency in central
(satellite) galaxies.},

  doi = {10.1051/0004-6361/201117308},
  abstract = {We present the results of a study of weak gravitational lensing by 
galaxies using imaging data that were obtained as part of the second Red
Sequence Cluster Survey (RCS2). In order to compare to the baryonic
properties of the lenses we focus here on the \textasciitilde{}300 square degrees that
overlap with the data release 7 (DR7) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS). The depth and image quality of the RCS2 enables us to
significantly improve upon earlier work for luminous galaxies at z $\geq$
0.3. To model the lensing signal we employ a halo model which accounts
for the clustering of the lenses and distinguishes between satellite and
central galaxies. Comparison with dynamical masses from the SDSS shows a
good correlation with the lensing mass for early-type galaxies. The
correlation is less clear for late-type galaxies, possibly due to
rotation. For low luminosity (stellar mass) early-type galaxies we find
a satellite fraction of \textasciitilde{}40\% which rapidly decreases to $<$10\% with
increasing luminosity (stellar mass). The satellite fraction of the
late-types has a value in the range 0-15\%, independent of luminosity or
stellar mass. At high masses the satellite fraction is not well
constrained, which we partly attribute to the modelling assumptions. To
infer virial masses we apply simple models based on an independent
satellite kinematics analysis to account for intrinsic scatter in the
scaling relations. We find that early-types in the range 1010
$<$ Lr $<$ 1011.5 L$\odot$ have virial
masses that are about five times higher than those of late-type galaxies
and that the mass scales as M200 $\propto$
L2.34-0.16+0.09. For an early-type
galaxy with a fiducal luminosity of 1011 Lr, $\odot$
, we obtain a mass M200 =
(1.93-0.14+0.13)\texttimes{}1013
h-1 M$\odot$. We also measure the virial
mass-to-light ratio, and find for L200 $<$ 1011
L$\odot$ a value of M200/L200 = 42
$\pm$ 10 for early-types, which increases for higher luminosities to
values that are consistent with those observed for groups and clusters
of galaxies. For late-type galaxies we find a lower value of
M200/L200 = 17 $\pm$ 9. Our measurements also
show that early- and late-type galaxies have comparable halo masses for
stellar masses M${_\ast}$ $<$ 1011
M$\odot$, whereas the virial masses of early-type galaxies are
higher for higher stellar masses. To compare the efficiency with which
baryons have been converted into stars, we determine the total stellar
mass within r200. Our results for early-type galaxies suggest
a variation in efficiency with a minimum of \textasciitilde{}10\% for a stellar mass
M${_\ast}$,200 = 1012 M$\odot$. The
results for the late-type galaxies are not well constrained, but do
suggest a larger value.},

  abstract = {We measure the evolution in the virial mass-to-light ratio 
(M200/LB) and virial-to-stellar mass ratio
(M200/M*) for isolated \textasciitilde{}L* galaxies between z\textasciitilde{}1
and z\textasciitilde{}0 by combining data from the DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey and the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Utilizing the motions of satellite galaxies
around isolated galaxies, we measure line-of-sight velocity dispersions
and derive dark matter halo virial masses for these host galaxies. At
both epochs the velocity dispersion of satellites correlates with host
galaxy stellar mass, $\sigma$\textasciitilde{}M0.4+/-0.1*, while
the relation between satellite velocity dispersion and host galaxy
B-band luminosity may grow somewhat shallower from
$\sigma$\textasciitilde{}L0.6+/-0.1B at z\textasciitilde{}1 to
$\sigma$\textasciitilde{}L0.4+/-0.1B at z\textasciitilde{}0. The evolution in
M200/M* from z\textasciitilde{}1 to z\textasciitilde{}0 displays a bimodality
insofar as host galaxies with stellar mass below
M*\textasciitilde{}1011 h-1 Msolar maintain
a constant ratio (the intrinsic increase is constrained to a factor of
1.1+/-0.5) while host galaxies above M*\textasciitilde{}1011
h-1 Msolar experience a factor of 3.3+/-2.2
increase in their virial-to-stellar mass ratio. This result can be
easily understood if galaxies below this stellar mass scale continue to
form stars while star formation in galaxies above this scale is quenched
and the dark matter halos of galaxies both above and below this scale
grow in accordance with $\Lambda$CDM cosmological simulations. Host
galaxies that are red in U-B color have larger satellite dispersions and
hence reside on average in more massive halos than blue galaxies at both
z\textasciitilde{}1 and z\textasciitilde{}0. The satellite population of host galaxies varies little
between these epochs. The redshift and host galaxy stellar mass
dependence of M200/M* agrees qualitatively with
the Millennium Run semianalytic model of galaxy formation.},

  volume = {431},
  issn = {0035-8711},
  doi = {10.1093/mnras/stt190},
  abstract = {We have constructed an extended halo model (EHM) which relates the total 
stellar mass and star-formation rate (SFR) to halo mass (Mh).
An empirical relation between the distribution functions of total
stellar mass of galaxies and host halo mass, tuned to match the spatial
density of galaxies over 0 $<$ z $<$ 2 and the clustering properties
at z \texttildelow{} 0, is extended to include two different scenarios
describing the variation of SFR on Mh. We also present new
measurements of the redshift evolution of the average SFR for
star-forming galaxies of different stellar masses up to z = 2, using
data from the Herschel Multi-tiered Extragalactic Survey for infrared
bright galaxies.

Combining the EHM with the halo accretion histories from numerical
simulations, we trace the stellar mass growth and star-formation history
in haloes spanning a range of masses. We find that: (1) the intensity of
the star-forming activity in haloes in the probed mass range has
steadily decreased from z \texttildelow{} 2 to 0; (2) at a given epoch, haloes
in the mass range between a few times 1011 M$\odot$
and a few times 1012 M$\odot$ are the most efficient
at hosting star formation; (3) the peak of SFR density shifts to lower
mass haloes over time; and (4) galaxies that are forming stars most
actively at z \texttildelow{} 2 evolve into quiescent galaxies in today's group
environments, strongly supporting previous claims that the most powerful
starbursts at z \texttildelow{} 2 are progenitors of today's elliptical
galaxies.},
