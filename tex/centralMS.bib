  abstract = {We examine the dependence of the mass-to-light (M/L) ratio of large-scale structure on cosmological parameters, in models that are constrained to match observations of the projected galaxy correlation function wp(rp) and the galaxy luminosity
function. For a sequence of cosmological models with a fixed,
observationally motivated power spectrum shape and increasing
normalization $\sigma$8, we find parameters of the galaxy halo occupation distribution (HOD) that reproduce
wp(rp) measurements as a function of luminosity from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). From these HOD models we calculate the r-band conditional luminosity function
$\Phi$(L|Mh), and from this the mean M/L ratio as a function of halo mass Mh. We also use $\Phi$(L|Mh) to
populate halos of N-body simulations with galaxies and thereby compute M/L in a range of large-scale environments, including cluster infall regions. For all cosmological models, the M/L ratio in high-mass halos or high-density regions is approximately independent of halo mass or smoothing scale. However, the ``plateau'' value of M/L depends on $\sigma$8 in addition to the obvious proportionality with the matter density parameter $\Omega$m, and it represents the
universal value
=$\Omega$m$\rho$crit/$\rho$lum
only for models in which the galaxy correlation function is
approximately unbiased, i.e., with
$\sigma$8\textasciitilde$\sigma$8g. Our results for cluster mass
halos follow the trend
(M/L)cl=577($\Omega$m/0.3)($\sigma$8/0.9)1.7 h Msolar/Lsolar. Combined with the mean M/L ratio for CNOC galaxy clusters, this relation implies
($\sigma$8/0.9)($\Omega$m/0.3)0.6=0.75+/-0.06. M/L estimates for SDSS clusters and the virial regions of clusters in the CAIRNS survey imply a similar value of
$\sigma$8$\Omega$0.6m, while the CAIRNS
estimates for cluster infall regions imply a lower value. These results are inconsistent with parameter values $\Omega$m\textasciitilde{}0.3,
$\sigma$8\textasciitilde{}0.9 favored by recent joint analyses of cosmic
microwave background measurements and other large-scale structure data, although they agree with values inferred from the van den Bosch et al. analysis of the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey. We discuss possible
resolutions of this discrepancy, none of which seems entirely
satisfactory. In appendices we present an improved formula for halo bias factors calibrated on our 3603 N-body simulations and an improved analytic technique for calculating the galaxy correlation function from a given cosmological model and HOD.},

clustering amplitude ($\sigma$8) of matter using a combination
of two measurements from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey: the galaxy
two-point correlation function, wp (rp ), and the
mass-to-galaxy-number ratio within galaxy clusters, M/N, analogous to
cluster M/L ratios. Our wp (rp ) measurements are
obtained from DR7 while the sample of clusters is the maxBCG sample,
with cluster masses derived from weak gravitational lensing. We
construct nonlinear galaxy bias models using the Halo Occupation
Distribution (HOD) to fit both wp (rp ) and M/N
for different cosmological parameters. HOD models that match the same
two-point clustering predict different numbers of galaxies in massive
halos when $\Omega$ m or $\sigma$8 is varied,
thereby breaking the degeneracy between cosmology and bias. We
demonstrate that this technique yields constraints that are consistent
and competitive with current results from cluster abundance studies,
without the use of abundance information. Using wp
(rp ) and M/N alone, we find $\Omega$0.5 m
$\sigma$8 = 0.465 $\pm$ 0.026, with individual
constraints of $\Omega$ m = 0.29 $\pm$ 0.03 and
$\sigma$8 = 0.85 $\pm$ 0.06. Combined with current cosmic
microwave background data, these constraints are $\Omega$ m =
0.290 $\pm$ 0.016 and $\sigma$8 = 0.826 $\pm$ 0.020. All
errors are 1$\sigma$. The systematic uncertainties that the M/N technique
are most sensitive to are the amplitude of the bias function of dark
matter halos and the possibility of redshift evolution between the SDSS
Main sample and the maxBCG cluster sample. Our derived constraints are
insensitive to the current level of uncertainties in the halo mass
function and in the mass-richness relation of clusters and its scatter,
making the M/N technique complementary to cluster abundances as a method
for constraining cosmology with future galaxy surveys.},

  abstract = {We present the first scientific results from the luminous red galaxy sample (LRG) of the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS). We measure the small and intermediate scale clustering from a sample of more than 61,000 galaxies in the redshift range \$0.6 $<$ z $<$ 0.9\$. We interpret these measurements in the framework of the Halo Occupation Distribution. The bias of eBOSS LRGs is \$2.30 $\backslash$pm 0.03\$, with a satellite fraction of \$13$\backslash$pm3\$$\backslash$\% and a mean halo mass of \$2.5$\backslash$times10\^\{13\}h\^\{-1\}M\_\{$\backslash$odot\}\$. These results are consistent with expectations, demonstrating that eBOSS galaxies will be reliable tracers of large scale structure at \$z$\backslash$sim 0.7\$. The eBOSS galaxy bias implies a scatter of luminosity at fixed halo mass, \$$\backslash$sigma\_\{$\backslash$log L\}\$, of 0.19 dex. Using the clustering of massive galaxies from BOSS-CMASS, BOSS-LOWZ, and SDSS, we find that \$$\backslash$sigma\_\{$\backslash$log L\}=0.19\$ is consistent with observations over the full redshift range that these samples cover. The addition of eBOSS to previous surveys allows investigation of the evolution of massive galaxies over the past \$$\backslash$sim 7\$ Gyr.},

  abstract = {Using some of the latest cosmological datasets publicly available, we derive the strongest bounds in the literature on the sum of the three active neutrino masses, \$M\_$\backslash$nu\$. In the most conservative scheme, combining Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature anisotropies and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) data, as well as the up-to-date constraint on the optical depth to reionization (\$$\backslash$tau\$), the tightest \$95$\backslash$\%\$ confidence level (C.L.) upper bound we find is \$M\_$\backslash$nu$<$0.151\$\textasciitilde{}eV. The addition of Planck high-\$$\backslash$ell\$ polarization tightens the bound to \$M\_$\backslash$nu$<$0.118\$\textasciitilde{}eV. Further improvements are possible when a less conservative prior on the Hubble parameter is added, bringing down the \$95$\backslash$\%\$\textasciitilde{}C.L. upper limit to \$$\backslash$sim 0.09\$\textasciitilde{}eV. The three aforementioned combinations exclude values of \$M\_$\backslash$nu\$ larger than the minimal value allowed in the inverted hierarchical (IH) mass ordering, \$0.0986\$\textasciitilde{}eV, at \$$\backslash$sim 82$\backslash$\%\$\textasciitilde{}C.L., \$$\backslash$sim 91$\backslash$\%\$\textasciitilde{}C.L., and \$$\backslash$sim 96$\backslash$\%\$\textasciitilde{}C.L. respectively. A proper model comparison treatment shows that the same combinations exclude the IH at \$$\backslash$sim 64$\backslash$\%\$\textasciitilde{}C.L., \$$\backslash$sim 71$\backslash$\%\$\textasciitilde{}C.L., and \$$\backslash$sim 77$\backslash$\%\$\textasciitilde{}C.L. respectively. We test the stability of the bounds against the distribution of the total mass \$M\_$\backslash$nu\$ among the three mass eigenstates, finding that these are relatively stable against the choice of distributing the total mass among three (the usual approximation) or one mass eigenstate. Finally, we compare the constraining power of measurements of the full-shape galaxy power spectrum versus the BAO signature, from the BOSS survey. Even though the latest BOSS full shape measurements cover a larger volume and benefit from smaller error bars compared to previous similar measurements, the analysis method commonly adopted results in their constraining power still being less powerful than that of the extracted BAO signal.

  title = {Constraints on {{Assembly Bias}} from {{Galaxy Clustering}}},
  abstract = {We constrain the newly-introduced decorated Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) model using SDSS DR7 measurements of projected galaxy clustering or r-band luminosity threshold samples. The decorated HOD is a model for the galaxy-halo connection that augments the HOD by allowing for the possibility of galaxy assembly bias: galaxy luminosity may be correlated with dark matter halo properties besides mass, Mvir. We demonstrate that it is not possible to rule out galaxy assembly bias using DR7 measurements of galaxy clustering alone. Moreover, galaxy samples with Mr $<$ -20 and Mr $<$ -20.5 favor strong central galaxy assembly bias. These samples prefer scenarios in which high-concentration are more likely to host a central galaxy relative to low-concentration halos of the same mass. We exclude zero assembly bias with high significance for these samples. Satellite galaxy assembly bias is significant for the faintest sample, Mr $<$ -19. We find no evidence for assembly bias in the Mr $<$ -21 sample. Assembly bias should be accounted for in galaxy clustering analyses or attempts to exploit galaxy clustering to constrain cosmology. In addition to presenting the first constraints on HOD models that accommodate assembly bias, our analysis includes several improvements over previous analyses of these data. Therefore, our inferences supersede previously-published results even in the case of a standard HOD analysis.},

effect known as assembly bias. If galaxy characteristics are correlated
with these auxiliary halo properties, the basic assumption of standard
HOD/CLF methods is violated. We estimate the potential for assembly bias
to induce systematic errors in inferred halo occupation statistics. We
construct realistic mock galaxy catalogues that exhibit assembly bias as
well as companion mock catalogues with identical HODs, but with assembly
bias removed. We fit HODs to the galaxy clustering in each catalogue. In
the absence of assembly bias, the inferred HODs describe the true HODs
well, validating the methodology. However, in all cases with assembly
bias, the inferred HODs exhibit significant systematic errors. We
conclude that the galaxy-halo relationship inferred from galaxy
clustering is subject to significant systematic errors induced by
assembly bias. Efforts to model and/or constrain assembly bias should be
priorities as assembly bias is a threatening source of systematic error

surveys offer an attractive method for measuring the build-up of
cosmological structure, which depends both on the expansion rate of the
Universe and on our theory of gravity. The statistical precision with
which redshift-space distortions can now be measured demands better
control of our theoretical systematic errors. While many recent studies
focus on understanding dark matter clustering in redshift space,
galaxies occupy special places in the universe: dark matter haloes. In
our detailed study of halo clustering and velocity statistics in 67.5
h-3 Gpc3 of N-body simulations, we uncover a
complex dependence of redshift-space clustering on halo bias. We
identify two distinct corrections which affect the halo redshift-space
correlation function on quasi-linear scales (\texttildelow{}30-80 h-1
Mpc): the non-linear mapping between real-space and redshift-space
positions, and the non-linear suppression of power in the velocity
divergence field. We model the first non-perturbatively using the
scale-dependent Gaussian streaming model, which we show is accurate at
the $<$0.5 (2) per cent level in transforming real-space clustering and
velocity statistics into redshift space on scales s $>$ 10 (s $>$ 25)
h-1 Mpc for the monopole (quadrupole) halo correlation
functions. The dominant correction to the Kaiser limit in this model
scales like b3. We use standard perturbation theory to
predict the real-space pairwise halo velocity statistics. Our fully
analytic model is accurate at the 2 per cent level only on scales s $>$
40 h-1 Mpc for the range of halo masses we studied (with b=
1.4-2.8). We find that recent models of halo redshift-space clustering
that neglect the corrections from the bispectrum and higher order terms
from the non-linear real-space to redshift-space mapping will not have
the accuracy required for current and future observational analyses.
Finally, we note that our simulation results confirm the essential but
non-trivial assumption that on large scales, the bias inferred from the
real-space clustering of haloes is the same as the one that determines
their pairwise infall velocity amplitude at the per cent level.},

The derivation recovers the familiar linear theory result on large scales but has the advantage of clearly revealing the dependence of the redshift distortions on the underlying peculiar velocity field; streaming motions give rise to distortions of \$\{$\backslash$cal O\}($\backslash$Omega\^\{0.6\}/b)\$ while variations in the anisotropic velocity dispersion yield terms of order \$\{$\backslash$cal O\}($\backslash$Omega\^\{1.2\}/b\^2)\$. This probabilistic derivation of the redshift-space correlation function is similar in spirit to the derivation of the commonly used ``streaming'' model, in which the distortions are given by a convolution of the real-space correlation function with a velocity distribution function. The streaming model is often used to model the redshift-space correlation function on small, highly non-linear, scales. There have been claims in the literature, however, that the streaming model is not valid in the linear regime.

  abstract = {Large surveys of the local Universe have shown that galaxies with different intrinsic properties such as colour, luminosity and
morphological type display a range of clustering amplitudes. Galaxies are therefore not faithful tracers of the underlying matter
distribution. This modulation of galaxy clustering, called bias, contains information about the physics behind galaxy formation. It is also a systematic to be overcome before the large-scale structure of the Universe can be used as a cosmological probe. Two types of approaches have been developed to model the clustering of galaxies. The first class is empirical and filters or weights the distribution of dark matter to reproduce the measured clustering. In the second approach, an attempt is made to model the physics which governs the fate of baryons in order to predict the number of galaxies in dark matter haloes. I will review the development of both approaches and summarise what we have learnt about galaxy bias.},

  abstract = {Recent observations of the distant Universe suggest that much of the stellar mass of bright galaxies was already in place at z $>$ 1. This presents a challenge for models of galaxy formation because massive haloes are assembled late in the hierarchical clustering process intrinsic to the cold dark matter (CDM) cosmology. In this paper, we discuss a new implementation of the Durham semi-analytic model of galaxy formation in which feedback due to active galactic nuclei (AGN) is assumed to quench cooling flows in massive haloes. This mechanism naturally creates a break in the local galaxy luminosity function at bright magnitudes. The model is implemented within the Millennium N-body simulation. The accurate dark matter merger trees and large number of realizations of the galaxy formation process enabled by this simulation result in highly accurate statistics. After adjusting the values of the physical parameters in the model by reference to the properties of the local galaxy population, we investigate the evolution of the K-band luminosity and galaxy stellar mass functions. We calculate the
volume-averaged star formation rate density of the Universe as a function of redshift and the way in which this is apportioned amongst galaxies of different mass. The model robustly predicts a substantial population of massive galaxies out to redshift z \textasciitilde{} 5 and a star
formation rate density which rises at least out to z \textasciitilde{} 2 in objects of all masses. Although observational data on these properties have been cited as evidence for `antihierarchical' galaxy formation, we find that when AGN feedback is taken into account, the fundamentally hierarchical CDM model provides a very good match to these observations.},

Our combined galaxy sample comprises 1.2 million massive galaxies over an effective area of 9329 deg\^2 and volume of 18.7 Gpc\^3, divided into three partially overlapping redshift slices centred at effective redshifts 0.38, 0.51, and 0.61. We measure the angular diameter distance DM and Hubble parameter H from the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) method after applying reconstruction to reduce non-linear effects on the BAO feature. Using the anisotropic clustering of the pre-reconstruction density field, we measure the product DM*H from the Alcock-Paczynski (AP) effect and the growth of structure, quantified by f\{$\backslash$sigma\}8(z), from redshift-space distortions (RSD). We combine measurements presented in seven companion papers into a set of consensus values and likelihoods, obtaining constraints that are tighter and more robust than those from any one method. Combined with Planck 2015 cosmic microwave background measurements, our distance scale measurements simultaneously imply curvature \{$\backslash$Omega\}\_K =0.0003+/-0.0026 and a dark energy equation of state parameter w = -1.01+/-0.06, in strong affirmation of the spatially flat cold dark matter model with a cosmological constant (\{$\backslash$Lambda\}CDM). Our RSD measurements of f\{$\backslash$sigma\}\_8, at 6 per cent precision, are similarly consistent with this model. When combined with supernova Ia data, we find H0 = 67.3+/-1.0 km/s/Mpc even for our most general dark energy model, in tension with some direct measurements. Adding extra relativistic species as a degree of freedom loosens the constraint only slightly, to H0 = 67.8+/-1.2 km/s/Mpc. Assuming flat \{$\backslash$Lambda\}CDM we find \{$\backslash$Omega\}\_m = 0.310+/-0.005 and H0 = 67.6+/-0.5 km/s/Mpc, and we find a 95\% upper limit of 0.16 eV/c\^2 on the neutrino mass sum.},

  abstract = {We examine the growth and evolution of quenched galaxies in the Mufasa cosmological hydrodynamic simulations that include an evolving halo mass-based quenching prescription, with galaxy colours computed accounting for line-of-sight extinction to individual star particles. Mufasa reproduces the observed present-day red sequence quite well, including its slope, amplitude, and scatter. In Mufasa, the red sequence slope is driven entirely by the steep stellar mass-stellar metallicity relation, which independently agrees with observations. High-mass star-forming galaxies blend smoothly onto the red sequence, indicating the lack of a well-defined green valley at M*$>$10\^10.5 Mo. The most massive galaxies quench the earliest and then grow very little in mass via dry merging; they attain their high masses at earlier epochs when cold inflows more effectively penetrate hot halos. To higher redshifts, the red sequence becomes increasingly contaminated with massive dusty star-forming galaxies; UVJ selection subtly but effectively separates these populations. We then examine the evolution of the mass functions of central and satellite galaxies split into passive and star-forming via UVJ. Massive quenched systems show good agreement with observations out to z\textasciitilde{}2, despite not including a rapid early quenching mode associated with mergers. However, low-mass quenched galaxies are far too numerous at z$<$1 in Mufasa, indicating that Mufasa strongly over-quenches satellites. A challenge for hydrodynamic simulations is to devise a quenching model that produces enough early massive quenched galaxies and keeps them quenched to z=0, while not being so strong as to over-quench satellites; Mufasa only succeeds at the former.},

  abstract = {The galaxy stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) is nearly 
time-independent for z $<$ 4. We therefore construct a time-independent SHMR model for central galaxies, wherein the in situ star formation rate (SFR) is determined by the halo mass accretion rate (MAR), which we call stellar halo accretion rate coevolution (SHARC). We show that the \texttildelow{}0.3 dex dispersion of the halo MAR matches the observed
dispersion of the SFR on the star formation main sequence (MS). In the context of `bathtub'-type models of galaxy formation, SHARC leads to mass-dependent constraints on the relation between SFR and MAR. Despite its simplicity and the simplified treatment of mass growth from mergers, the SHARC model is likely to be a good approximation for central galaxies with M* = 109-1010.5
M$\odot$ that are on the MS, representing most of the star
formation in the Universe. SHARC predictions agree with observed SFRs for galaxies on the MS at low redshifts, agree fairly well at z \texttildelow{} 4, but exceed observations at z $\greaterequivlnt$ 4. Assuming that the interstellar gas mass is constant for each galaxy (the `equilibrium condition' in bathtub models), the SHARC model allows calculation of net mass loading factors for inflowing and outflowing gas. With assumptions about preventive feedback based on simulations, SHARC allows calculation of galaxy metallicity evolution. If galaxy SFRs indeed track halo MARs, especially at low redshifts, that may help explain the success of models linking galaxy properties to haloes (including age-matching) and the similarities between two-halo galaxy conformity and halo mass accretion conformity.},

  shorttitle = {Dark Matter Statistics for Large Galaxy Catalogs},
  abstract = {Upcoming and existing large-scale surveys of galaxies require accurate theoretical predictions of the dark matter clustering statistics for thousands of mock galaxy catalogs. We demonstrate that this goal can be achieve with our new Parallel Particle-Mesh (PM) Nbody code (PPM-GLAM) at a very low computational cost. We run about 15,000 simulations with \textasciitilde{}2 billion particles that provide \textasciitilde{}1\% accuracy of the dark matter power spectra P(k) for wave-numbers up to k\textasciitilde{} 1h/Mpc. Using this large data-set we study the power spectrum covariance matrix, the stepping stone for producing mock catalogs. In contrast to many previous analytical and numerical results, we find that the covariance matrix normalised to the power spectrum C(k,k')/P(k)P(k') has a complex structure of non-diagonal components. It has an upturn at small k, followed by a minimum at k=0.1-0.2h/Mpc. It also has a maximum at k=0.5-0.6h/Mpc. The normalised covariance matrix strongly evolves with redshift: C(k,k')\textasciitilde{}delta(t)\^alpha P(k)P(k'), where delta is the linear growth factor and alpha \textasciitilde{} 1-1.25, which indicates that the covariance matrix depends on cosmological parameters. We also show that waves longer than 1Gpc have very little impact on the power spectrum and covariance matrix. This significantly reduces the computational costs and complexity of theoretical predictions: relatively small volume \textasciitilde{} (1Gpc)\^3 simulations capture the necessary properties of dark matter clustering statistics. All the power spectra obtained from many thousands of our simulations are publicly available.},

After introducing an averaged, reasonably fast to evaluate, trispectrum estimator, we show that the expected errors on linear and quadratic bias parameters can be reduced by at least 20-40\%. Also, the inclusion of the trispectrum information, which is sensitive to "three-dimensionality" of structures, helps significantly in constraining the mass dependence of the HOD mean. Our approach depends only on adequate modeling of the abundance and large-scale clustering of halos and thus is independent of details of how galaxies are distributed within halos. This provides a consistency check on the traditional approach of using two-point statistics down to small scales, which necessarily makes more assumptions. We present a detailed forecast of how well our approach can be carried out in the case of the SDSS.},

the matter density $\Omega$m, power spectrum normalization

circumventing the linear theory distortion parameter $\beta$ and
eliminating nuisance parameters for non-linearities. The model is
constructed within the framework of the halo occupation distribution
(HOD), which quantifies galaxy bias on linear and non-linear scales. We
model one-halo pairwise velocities by assuming that satellite galaxy
velocities follow a Gaussian distribution with dispersion proportional
to the virial dispersion of the host halo. Two-halo velocity statistics
are a combination of virial motions and host halo motions. The velocity
distribution function (DF) of halo pairs is a complex function with
skewness and kurtosis that vary substantially with scale. Using a series
of collisionless N-body simulations, we demonstrate that the shape of
the velocity DF is determined primarily by the distribution of local
densities around a halo pair, and at fixed density the velocity DF is
close to Gaussian and nearly independent of halo mass. We calibrate a
model for the conditional probability function of densities around halo
pairs on these simulations. With this model, the full shape of the halo
velocity DF can be accurately calculated as a function of halo mass,
radial separation, angle and cosmology. The HOD approach to
redshift-space distortions utilizes clustering data from linear to
non-linear scales to break the standard degeneracies inherent in
previous models of redshift-space clustering. The parameters of the
occupation function are well constrained by real-space clustering alone,
separating constraints on bias and cosmology. We demonstrate the ability
of the model to separately constrain
$\Omega$m,$\sigma$8 and $\alpha$v in
models that are constructed to have the same value of $\beta$ at large
scales as well as the same finger-of-god distortions at small scales.},

beyond the baryon acoustic oscillation feature. This model also agrees
remarkably well with the BOSS galaxy power spectrum (up to k \texttildelow{} 1 h

quadrupole of the correlation function presents some tensions with
observations. We discuss possible causes that can explain this

We propose a phenomenological model that incorporates the perturbative results and also describes the bispectrum in the transition to the nonlinear regime. We stress the importance of nonlinear effects and show that inaccurate treatment of these can lead to significant discrepancies in the determination of bias from galaxy redshift surveys. At small scales we find that the bispectrum monopole exhibits a strong
configuration dependence that reflects the velocity dispersion of clusters. Therefore the hierarchical model for the three-point function does not hold in redshift space.},

In this approach, all mass is associated with virialized dark matter halos; models of the number and spatial distribution of the halos, and the distribution of dark matter within each halo, are used to provide estimates of how the statistical properties of large scale density and velocity fields evolve as a result of nonlinear gravitational clustering. We first describe the model, and demonstrate its accuracy by comparing its predictions with exact results from numerical simulations of nonlinear gravitational clustering. We then present several astrophysical applications of the halo model: these include models of the spatial distribution of galaxies, the nonlinear velocity, momentum and pressure fields, descriptions of weak gravitational lensing, and estimates of secondary contributions to temperature fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background.},

  abstract = {Modeling galaxy formation in a cosmological context presents one of the greatest challenges in astrophysics today, due to the vast range of scales and numerous physical processes involved. Here we review the current status of models that employ two leading techniques to simulate the physics of galaxy formation: semi-analytic models and numerical hydrodynamic simulations. We focus on a set of observational targets that describe the evolution of the global and structural properties of galaxies from roughly Cosmic High Noon (\$z$\backslash$sim 2-3\$) to the present. Although minor discrepancies remain, overall, models show remarkable convergence between different methods and make predictions that are in qualitative agreement with observations. Modelers seem to have converged on a core set of physical processes that are critical for shaping galaxy properties. This core set includes cosmological accretion, strong stellar-driven winds that are more efficient at low masses, black hole feedback that preferentially suppresses star formation at high masses, and structural and morphological evolution through merging and environmental processes. However, all cosmological models currently adopt phenomenological implementations of many of these core processes, which must be tuned to observations. Many details of how these diverse processes interact within a hierarchical structure formation setting remain poorly understood. Emerging multi-scale simulations are helping to bridge the gap between stellar and cosmological scales, placing models on a firmer, more physically grounded footing. Concurrently, upcoming telescope facilities will provide new challenges and constraints for models, particularly by directly constraining inflows and outflows through observations of gas in and around galaxies.},

role along with purely gravitational processes. The gist of the model is
that the distribution of the dominant mass component on all scales
arises from purely gravitational clustering, while the observed sizes

dissipative processes. The model accounts for the large amount of
nongaseous 'dark matter', apparently making up about 80\% or more of the
virial mass in clusters such as Coma and which may constitute massive
halos around large galaxies. At work is a process of self-similar
gravitational clustering in an expanding universe. The clustering builds
up in hierarchical fashion; the smaller-scale virialized systems merge
into an amorphous whole when they are incorporated in a larger bound
cluster. Residual gas in the resulting potential wells cools and
acquires sufficient concentration to self-gravitate, forming luminous
galaxies up to a limiting size. This limit agrees adequately with the
masses, luminosities, and radii of large galaxies. On certain specific
assumptions, a luminosity function is derived that agrees reasonably
well with observation.},

  abstract = {Recent discovery of many dwarf satellite galaxies in the direction of 
the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds (SMC and LMC) provokes questions
of their origins, and what they can reveal about galaxy evolution
theory. Here, we predict the satellite stellar mass function of
Magellanic Cloud-mass host galaxies using abundance matching and
reionization models applied to the Caterpillar simulations. Specifically
focusing on the volume within 50 kpc of the LMC, we predict a mean of
4-8 satellites with stellar mass \$M\_* $>$ 10\^4 $\backslash$, $\backslash$mathrm\{M\_$\backslash$odot\}\$,
and 3-4 satellites with \$80 $<$ M\_* $\backslash$leq 3000 $\backslash$, $\backslash$mathrm\{M\_$\backslash$odot\}\$.
Surprisingly, all \$12\$ currently known satellite candidates have stellar
masses of \$80 $<$ M\_* $\backslash$leq 3000 $\backslash$, $\backslash$mathrm\{M\_$\backslash$odot\}\$. Reconciling the
dearth of large satellites and profusion of small satellites is
challenging and may require a combination of a major modification of the
\$M\_* - M\_\{$\backslash$rm\{halo\}\}\$ relationship (steep, but with an abrupt flattening
at \$10\^3 $\backslash$, $\backslash$mathrm\{M\_$\backslash$odot\}\$), late reionization for the Local Group
(\$z\_\{$\backslash$rm\{reion\}\} $\backslash$lesssim 9\$ preferred), and/or strong tidal stripping.
We can more robustly predict that \$$\backslash$sim 53$\backslash$\%\$ of satellites within this
volume were accreted together with the LMC and SMC, and \$$\backslash$sim 47$\backslash$\%\$ were
only ever Milky Way satellites. Observing satellites of isolated
LMC-sized field galaxies is essential to placing the LMC in context, and
to better constrain the \$M\_* - M\_\{$\backslash$rm\{halo\}\}\$ relationship. Modeling
known LMC-sized galaxies within \$8\$ Mpc, we predict 1-6 (2-12)
satellites with \$M\_* $>$ 10\^5 $\backslash$, $\backslash$mathrm\{M\_$\backslash$odot\}\$ (\$M\_* $>$ 10\^4 $\backslash$,
$\backslash$mathrm\{M\_$\backslash$odot\}\$) within the virial volume of each, and 1-3 (1-7)

This dependence on the formation history, which is highly correlated with halo concentration, can account for the super-Poissonian scatter in subhalo occupation at a fixed halo mass that has been previously measured in simulations. Here we propose a model to predict the subhalo abundance function for individual host halos that incorporates both halo mass and concentration. We combine results of cosmological simulations with a new suite of zoom-in simulations of Milky Way-mass halos to calibrate our model. We show that the model can successfully reproduce the mean and the scatter of subhalo occupation in these simulations. The implications of this correlation between subhalo abundance and halo concentration are further investigated. We also discuss cases in which inferences about halo properties can be affected if this correlation between subhalo abundance and halo concentration is ignored; in these cases, our model would give a more accurate inference. We propose that with future deep surveys, satellite occupation in the low-mass regime can be used to verify the existence of halo assembly bias.},

  abstract = {In order to be efficient, spectroscopic galaxy redshift surveys do not obtain redshifts for all galaxies in the population targeted. The missing galaxies are often clustered, commonly leading to a lower proportion of successful observations in dense regions. One example is the close-pair issue for SDSS spectroscopic galaxy surveys, which have a deficit of pairs of observed galaxies with angular separation closer than the hardware limit on placing neighbouring fibers. Spatially clustered missing observations will exist in the next generations of surveys. Various schemes have previously been suggested to mitigate these effects, but none works for all situations. We argue that the solution is to link the missing galaxies to those observed with
statistically equivalent clustering properties, and that the best way to do this is to rerun the targeting algorithm, varying the angular position of the observations. Provided that every pair has a non-zero probability of being observed in one realisation of the algorithm, then a pair-upweighting scheme linking targets to successful observations, can correct these issues. We present such a scheme, and demonstrate its validity using realisations of an idealised simple survey strategy.},

  title = {Accurate Halo-Galaxy Mocks from Automatic Bias Estimation and Particle Mesh Gravity Solvers},
  abstract = {Reliable extraction of cosmological information from clustering measurements of galaxy surveys requires estimation of the error covariance matrices of observables. The accuracy of covariance matrices is limited by our ability to generate sufficiently large number of independent mock catalogs that can describe the physics of galaxy clustering across a wide range of scales. Furthermore, galaxy mock catalogs are required to study systematics in galaxy surveys and to test analysis tools. In this investigation, we present a fast and accurate approach for generation of mock catalogs for the upcoming galaxy surveys. Our method relies on low-resolution approximate gravity solvers to simulate the large scale dark matter field, which we then populate with halos according to a flexible nonlinear and stochastic bias model. In particular, we extend the patchy code with an efficient particle mesh algorithm to simulate the dark matter field (the FastPM code), and with an efficient and robust MCMC method relying on the emcee code for constraining the parameters of the bias model. Using the halos in the BigMultiDark high-resolution \$N\$-body simulation as a reference catalog, we demonstrate that our technique can model the bivariate probability distribution function, power spectrum, and bispectrum of halos in the reference catalog. Specifically, we show that the new ingredients permit us to reach percentage accuracy in the power spectrum up to \$k$\backslash$sim 0.4$\backslash$; h$\backslash$mathrm\{Mpc\}\^\{-1\}\$ (within 5\$$\backslash$\%\$ up to \$k$\backslash$sim 0.6$\backslash$; h$\backslash$mathrm\{Mpc\}\^\{-1\}\$) with accurate bispectra improving previous results based on Lagrangian perturbation theory.},

analysis of DR11 on large scales, f$\sigma$8(z = 0.57) = 0.447
$\pm$ 0.028, and is the tightest single constraint on the growth rate
of cosmic structure to date. Our measurement is consistent with the
Planck $\Lambda$CDM prediction of 0.480 $\pm$ 0.010 at the
\texttildelow{}1.9$\sigma$ level. Assuming a halo mass function evaluated at the
best-fitting Planck cosmology, we also find that 10 per cent of CMASS
galaxies are satellites in haloes of mass M \texttildelow{} 6 \texttimes
1013 h-1 M$\odot$. While none of our
tests and model generalizations indicate systematic errors due to an
insufficiently detailed model of the galaxy-halo connection, the
precision of these first results warrant further investigation into the
modelling uncertainties and degeneracies with cosmological parameters.},

  shorttitle = {How Are Galaxies Assigned to Halos?},
  abstract = {Clustering of dark matter halos has been shown to depend on halo properties beyond mass such as halo concentration, a phenomenon referred to as halo assembly bias. Standard halo occupation modeling (HOD) in large scale structure studies assumes that halo mass alone is sufficient in characterizing the connection between galaxies and halos. Modeling of galaxy clustering can face systematic effects if the number of galaxies are correlated with other halo properties. Using the Small MultiDark-Planck high resolution \$N\$-body simulation and the measurements of the projected two-point correlation function and the number density of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR7 main galaxy sample, we investigate the extent to which the dependence of halo occupation on halo concentration can be constrained, and to what extent allowing for this dependence can improve our modeling of galaxy clustering. Given the SDSS clustering data, our constraints on HOD with assembly bias, suggests that satellite population is not correlated with halo concentration at fixed halo mass. Furthermore, in terms of the occupation of centrals at fixed halo mass, our results favor lack of correlation with halo concentration in the most luminous samples (\$M\_\{$\backslash$rm r\}$<$-21.5,-21\$), modest levels of correlation for \$M\_\{$\backslash$rm r\}$<$-20.5,-20, -19.5\$ samples, lack of correlation for \$M\_\{$\backslash$rm r\}$<$-19,-18.5\$ samples, and anti-correlation for the faintest sample \$M\_\{$\backslash$rm r\}$<$-18\$. We show that in comparison with abundance-matching mock catalogs, our findings suggest qualitatively similar but modest levels of the impact of assembly bias on galaxy clustering. That is, the effect is only present in the central occupation and becomes less significant in brighter galaxy samples. Furthermore, by performing model comparison based on information criteria, we find that in most cases, the mass-only HOD model is still favored by the observations.},

  abstract = {Massive neutrinos make up a fraction of the dark matter, but due to 
their large thermal velocities, cluster significantly less than cold
dark matter (CDM) on small scales. An accurate theoretical modelling of
their effect during the non-linear regime of structure formation is
required in order to properly analyse current and upcoming
high-precision large-scale structure data, and constrain the neutrino
mass. Taking advantage of the fact that massive neutrinos remain
linearly clustered up to late times, this paper treats the linear growth
of neutrino overdensities in a non-linear CDM background. The evolution
of the CDM component is obtained via N-body computations. The smooth
neutrino component is evaluated from that background by solving the
Boltzmann equation linearized with respect to the neutrino overdensity.
CDM and neutrinos are simultaneously evolved in time, consistently
accounting for their mutual gravitational influence. This method avoids
the issue of shot noise inherent to particle-based neutrino simulations,
and, in contrast with standard Fourier-space methods, properly accounts
for the non-linear potential wells in which the neutrinos evolve. Inside
the most massive late-time clusters, where the escape velocity is larger
than the neutrino thermal velocity, neutrinos can clump non-linearly,
causing the method to formally break down. It is shown that this does
not affect the total matter power spectrum, which can be very accurately
computed on all relevant scales up to the present time.},

  abstract = {We present constraints on cosmological parameters using number counts as a function of redshift for a sub-sample of 189 galaxy clusters from the Planck SZ (PSZ) catalogue. The PSZ is selected through the signature of the Sunyaev--Zeldovich (SZ) effect, and the sub-sample used here has a signal-to-noise threshold of seven, with each object confirmed as a cluster and all but one with a redshift estimate. We discuss the completeness of the sample and our construction of a likelihood analysis. Using a relation between mass \$M\$ and SZ signal \$Y\$ calibrated to X-ray measurements, we derive constraints on the power spectrum amplitude \$$\backslash$sigma\_8\$ and matter density parameter \$$\backslash$Omega\_\{$\backslash$mathrm\{m\}\}\$ in a flat \$$\backslash$Lambda\$CDM model. We test the robustness of our estimates and find that possible biases in the \$Y\$--\$M\$ relation and the halo mass function are larger than the statistical uncertainties from the cluster sample. Assuming the X-ray determined mass to be biased low relative to the true mass by between zero and 30\%, motivated by comparison of the observed mass scaling relations to those from a set of numerical simulations, we find that \$$\backslash$sigma\_8=0.75$\backslash$pm 0.03\$, \$$\backslash$Omega\_\{$\backslash$mathrm\{m\}\}=0.29$\backslash$pm 0.02\$, and \$$\backslash$sigma\_8($\backslash$Omega\_\{$\backslash$mathrm\{m\}\}/0.27)\^\{0.3\} = 0.764 $\backslash$pm 0.025\$. The value of \$$\backslash$sigma\_8\$ is degenerate with the mass bias; if the latter is fixed to a value of 20\% we find \$$\backslash$sigma\_8($\backslash$Omega\_\{$\backslash$mathrm\{m\}\}/0.27)\^\{0.3\}=0.78$\backslash$pm 0.01\$ and a tighter one-dimensional range \$$\backslash$sigma\_8=0.77$\backslash$pm 0.02\$. We find that the larger values of \$$\backslash$sigma\_8\$ and \$$\backslash$Omega\_\{$\backslash$mathrm\{m\}\}\$ preferred by Planck's measurements of the primary CMB anisotropies can be accommodated by a mass bias of about 40\%. Alternatively, consistency with the primary CMB constraints can be achieved by inclusion of processes that suppress power on small scales relative to the \$$\backslash$Lambda\$CDM model, such as a component of massive neutrinos (abridged).},

  abstract = {I present a comprehensive review of the evolution of galaxy structure in the universe from the first galaxies we can currently observe at z\textasciitilde{}6 down to galaxies we see in the local universe. I further address how these changes reveal galaxy formation processes that galaxy structural analyses can provide. This review is pedagogical and begins with a detailed discussion of the major methods in which galaxies are studied morphologically and structurally. This includes the well-established visual method; Sersic fitting to measure galaxy sizes and surface brightness profile shapes; non-parametric structural methods including the concentration (C), asymmetry (A), clumpiness (S) (CAS) method, as well as newer structural indices. Included is a discussion of how these structural indices measure fundamental properties of galaxies such as their scale, star formation rate, and ongoing merger activity. Extensive observational results are shown demonstrating how broad galaxy morphologies and structures change with time up to z\textasciitilde{}3, from small, compact and peculiar systems in the distant universe to the formation of the Hubble sequence we find today. This review further addresses how structural methods measure accurately the merger history out to z\textasciitilde{}3. The properties and evolution of bulges, disks, bars, and at z$>$1 large star forming clumps are also described, along with how morphological galaxy quenching occurs. Furthermore, the role of environment in producing structure in galaxies over cosmic time is treated. Alongside the evolution of general structure, I also delineate how galaxy sizes change with time, with measured sizes up to a factor of 2-5 smaller at high redshift at a given stellar mass. This review concludes with a discussion of how galaxy structure reveals the formation mechanisms behind galaxies, providing a new and unique way to test theories of galaxy formation.},

  abstract = {We use the hydrodynamical galaxy formation simulations from the Illustris suite to study the origin and properties of galaxy velocity bias, i.e., the difference between the velocity distributions of galaxies and dark matter inside halos. We find that galaxy velocity bias is a decreasing function of the ratio of galaxy stellar mass to host halo mass. In general, central galaxies are not at rest with respect to dark matter halos or the core of halos, with a velocity dispersion above 0.04 times that of the dark matter. The central galaxy velocity bias is found to be mostly caused by the close interactions between the central and satellite galaxies. For satellite galaxies, the velocity bias is related to their dynamical and tidal evolution history after being accreted onto the host halos. It depends on the time after the accretion and their distances from the halo centers, with massive satellites generally moving more slowly than the dark matter. The results are in broad agreements with those inferred from modeling small-scale redshift-space galaxy clustering data, and the study can help improve models of redshift-space galaxy clustering.},

Compared to our previously released catalogs, we make several improvements to the photometry, including smaller apertures, ICL subtraction, PSF matching, and empirically measured uncertainties. We further improve the Bayesian Photometric Redshift (BPZ) estimates by adding a redder elliptical template and by inflating the photometric uncertainties of the brightest galaxies.

Our new catalog includes 1257 spectroscopic redshifts, including 382 confirmed cluster members. We also provide stellar mass estimates. Finally, we include lensing magnification estimates of background galaxies based on our public lens models. Our new catalog of all 25 CLASH clusters is available via MAST. The analysis techniques developed here will be useful in other surveys of crowded fields, including the Frontier Fields and surveys carried out with J-PAS and JWST.},

  shorttitle = {Revisiting {{HOD}} Model Assumptions},
  abstract = {The standard Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) models were originally developed based on results from semi-analytic and hydrodynamical galaxy formation models. Those models have since progressed, in particular to include AGN feedback to match the galaxy luminosity function in a universe with the observed baryon fraction. AGN feedback affects the relationship between galaxy stellar mass and luminosity, in particular making the relationship non-monotonic. For matched number density samples, galaxies in luminosity-threshold samples occupy a different range of halo masses from those in stellar-mass-threshold samples. We find that the shapes of the HODs of luminosity-threshold samples are slightly more complicated in semi-analytic galaxy formation models that include AGN feedback than are assumed by standard HOD models. We also find that subhalo abundance matching (SHAM) does not preserve these non-standard shapes. We show that catalogues created using SHAM and the semi-analytic model Galform that have the same large-scale 2-point clustering by construction have different void probability functions (VPFs) in both real and redshift space. We find that these differences arise from the different HOD shapes, as opposed to assembly bias, which indicates that the VPF could be used to test the suitability of an HOD model with real data.},

To this purpose, we only need a statistically representative, rather than a complete, sample of low-mass galaxies, which enables our study to \$z$\backslash$gtrsim1.5\$. For each low-mass galaxy, we measure the projected distance (\$d\_\{proj\}\$) to its nearest massive neighbor (M*\$$>$10\^\{10.5\} M\_$\backslash$odot\$) within a redshift range. At a given redshift and M*, the environmental quenching effect is considered to be observed if the \$d\_\{proj\}\$ distribution of QGs (\$d\_\{proj\}\^Q\$) is significantly skewed toward lower values than that of star-forming galaxies (\$d\_\{proj\}\^\{SF\}\$). For galaxies with \$10\^\{8\} M\_$\backslash$odot $<$ M* $<$ 10\^\{10\} M\_$\backslash$odot\$, such a difference between \$d\_\{proj\}\^Q\$ and \$d\_\{proj\}\^\{SF\}\$ is detected up to \$z$\backslash$sim1\$. Also, about 10$\backslash$\% of the quenched galaxies in our sample are located between two and four Virial Radius (\$R\_\{Vir\}\$) of the massive halos. The median projected distance from low-mass QGs to their massive neighbors, \$d\_\{proj\}\^Q / R\_\{Vir\}\$, decreases with satellite M* at \$M* $\backslash$lesssim 10\^\{9.5\} M\_$\backslash$odot\$, but increases with satellite M* at \$M* $\backslash$gtrsim 10\^\{9.5\} M\_$\backslash$odot\$. This trend suggests a smooth, if any, transition of the quenching timescale around \$M* $\backslash$sim 10\^\{9.5\} M\_$\backslash$odot\$ at \$0.5$<$z$<$1.0\$.},

  shorttitle = {Quenching or {{Bursting}}},
  abstract = {We introduce a new methodology for the direct extraction of galaxy physical parameters from multi-wavelength photometry and spectroscopy. We use semi-analytic models that describe galaxy evolution in the context of large scale cosmological simulation to provide a catalog of galaxies, star formation histories, and physical parameters. We then apply stellar population synthesis models and a simple extinction model to calculate the observable broad-band fluxes and spectral indices for these galaxies. We use a linear regression analysis to relate physical parameters to observed colors and spectral indices. The result is a set of coefficients that can be used to translate observed colors and indices into stellar mass, star formation rate, and many other parameters, including the instantaneous time derivative of the star formation rate which we denote the \{$\backslash$it Star Formation Acceleration (SFA)\}, We apply the method to a test sample of galaxies with GALEX photometry and SDSS spectroscopy, deriving relationships between stellar mass, specific star formation rate, and star formation acceleration. We find evidence for a mass-dependent SFA in the green valley, with low mass galaxies showing greater quenching and higher mass galaxies greater bursting. We also find evidence for an increase in average quenching in galaxies hosting AGN. A simple scenario in which lower mass galaxies accrete and become satellite galaxies, having their star forming gas tidally and/or ram-pressure stripped, while higher mass galaxies receive this gas and react with new star formation can qualitatively explain our results.},

We use the full GASS sample to investigate environmental effects on the

environment is characterized in terms of dark matter halo mass, obtained
by cross-matching our sample with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)
group catalogue of Yang et al. Our analysis provides, for the first
time, clear statistical evidence that massive galaxies located in haloes
with masses of 1013-1014 M$\odot$ have at
least 0.4 dex less H I than objects in lower density environments. The
process responsible for the suppression of gas in group galaxies most
likely drives the observed quenching of the star formation in these
systems. Our findings strongly support the importance of the group
environment for galaxy evolution, and have profound implications for
semi-analytic models of galaxy formation, which currently do not allow
for stripping of the cold interstellar medium in galaxy groups.},

  title = {Brightest Galaxies as Halo Centre Tracers in {{SDSS DR7}}},
  abstract = {Determining the positions of halo centres in large-scale structure surveys is crucial for many cosmological studies. A common assumption is that halo centres correspond to the location of their brightest member galaxies. In this paper, we study the dynamics of brightest galaxies with respect to other halo members in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR7. Specifically, we look at the line-of-sight velocity and spatial offsets between brightest galaxies and their neighbours. We compare those to detailed mock catalogues, constructed from high-resolution, dark-matter-only \$N\$-body simulations, in which it is assumed that satellite galaxies trace dark matter subhaloes. This allows us to place constraints on the fraction \$f\_\{$\backslash$rm BNC\}\$ of haloes in which the brightest galaxy is not the central. Compared to previous studies we explicitly take into account the unrelaxed state of the host haloes, velocity offsets of halo cores and correlations between \$f\_\{$\backslash$rm BNC\}\$ and the satellite occupation. We find that \$f\_\{$\backslash$rm BNC\}\$ strongly decreases with the luminosity of the brightest galaxy and increases with the mass of the host halo. Overall, in the halo mass range \$10\^\{13\} - 10\^\{14.5\} h\^\{-1\} M\_$\backslash$odot\$ we find \$f\_\{$\backslash$rm BNC\} $\backslash$sim 30$\backslash$\%\$, in good agreement with a previous study by Skibba et al. We discuss the implications of these findings for studies inferring the galaxy--halo connection from satellite kinematics, models of the conditional luminosity function and galaxy formation in general.},

  abstract = {We present EMERGE, an Empirical ModEl for the foRmation of GalaxiEs, describing the evolution of individual galaxies in large volumes from \$z$\backslash$sim10\$ to the present day. We assign a star formation rate to each dark matter halo based on its growth rate, which specifies how much baryonic material becomes available, and the instantaneous baryon conversion efficiency, which determines how efficiently this material is converted to stars, thereby capturing the baryonic physics. Satellites are quenched following the delayed-then-rapid model, and they are tidally disrupted once their subhalo has lost a significant fraction of its mass. The model is constrained with observed data extending out to high redshift. The empirical relations are very flexible, and the model complexity is increased only if required by the data, assessed by several model selection statistics. We find that for the same final halo mass galaxies can have very different star formation histories. Nevertheless, the average star formation and accretion rates are in good agreement with models following an abundance matching strategy. Galaxies that are quenched at \$z=0\$ typically have a higher peak star formation rate compared to their star-forming counterparts. The accretion of stars can dominate the total mass of massive galaxies, but is insignificant for low-mass systems, independent of star-formation activity. EMERGE predicts stellar-to-halo mass ratios for individual galaxies and introduces scatter self-consistently. We find that at fixed halo mass, passive galaxies have a higher stellar mass on average. The intra-cluster-mass in massive haloes can be up to 8 times larger than the mass of the central galaxy. Clustering for star-forming and quenched galaxies is in good agreement with observational constraints, indicating a realistic assignment of galaxies to haloes.},

However, obtaining spectra of galaxies is expensive, and surveys often only measure redshifts for a subsample of a target galaxy population. Provided that the spectroscopic data is representative, we argue that angular pair upweighting should be used in these situations to improve the 3D clustering measurements. We present a toy model showing mathematically how such a weighting can improve measurements, and provide a practical example of its application using mocks created for the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). Our analysis of mocks suggests that, if an angular clustering measurement is available over twice the area covered spectroscopically, weighting gives a \$$\backslash$sim\$10-20\% reduction of the variance of the monopole correlation function on the BAO scale.},

  title = {Galactic Conformity Measured in Semi-Analytic Models},
  abstract = {We study the correlation between the specific star formation rate of central galaxies and neighbour galaxies, also known as 'galactic conformity', out to several Mpc scales using three different semi-analytic models (SAMs). It has been suggested that SAMs may not show the strong signal of conformity measured in observations. In all the models, when the selection of primary galaxies is based on an isolation criterion in real space, we measure a strong galactic conformity where the mean quenched fraction around quenched primary galaxies is higher than that around star-forming primary galaxies of the same stellar mass. The cumulative signal-to-noise ratio, which is used to evaluate the significance and extension in distance of conformity, depends strongly on the SAM. The two-halo conformity is significant as far as \textasciitilde{}5 Mpc/h. The overall signal of galactic conformity decreases when we remove satellites in the selection of primary galaxies. In this case, there is no significant two-halo conformity in two SAMs. For the other SAM, the two-halo conformity is only detected between isolated, central galaxies in relatively low-mass haloes (\$M\_\{$\backslash$rm halo\}\$ \$$<$ 10\^\{12.4\}\$ \$h\^\{-1\}\textasciitilde$\backslash$rm\{ M\_\{$\backslash$bigodot\}\}\$) and their neighbours. Finally, we explore the case when the secondary galaxies correspond to central galaxies in the SAMs as an attempt to measure the conformity between distinct haloes. Our results show that there is no conformity beyond \textasciitilde{}3 Mpc/h. The conformity measured out to scales of 3\$-\$4 Mpc/h can be related to the environmental influence of large galaxy clusters around near central galaxies.},

  title = {Large-{{Scale Galaxy Bias}}},
  abstract = {This review presents a comprehensive overview of galaxy bias, that is, the statistical relation between the distribution of galaxies and matter. We focus on large scales where cosmic density fields are quasi-linear. On these scales, the clustering of galaxies can be described by a perturbative bias expansion, and the complicated physics of galaxy formation is absorbed by a finite set of coefficients of the expansion, called bias parameters. The review begins with a detailed derivation of this very important result, which forms the basis of the rigorous perturbative description of galaxy clustering, under the assumptions of General Relativity and Gaussian, adiabatic initial conditions. Key components of the bias expansion are all leading local gravitational observables, which include the matter density but also tidal fields and their time derivatives. We hence expand the definition of local bias to encompass all these contributions. This derivation is followed by a presentation of the peak-background split in its general form, which elucidates the physical meaning of the bias parameters, and a detailed description of the connection between bias parameters and galaxy (or halo) statistics. We then review the excursion set formalism and peak theory which provide predictions for the values of the bias parameters. In the remainder of the review, we consider the generalizations of galaxy bias required in the presence of various types of cosmological physics that go beyond pressureless matter with adiabatic, Gaussian initial conditions: primordial non-Gaussianity, massive neutrinos, baryon-CDM isocurvature perturbations, dark energy, and modified gravity. Finally, we discuss how the description of galaxy bias in the galaxies' rest frame is related to clustering statistics measured from the observed angular positions and redshifts in actual galaxy catalogs.},

This procedure flags pairs of datapoints which depend on each other in a non-Gaussian fashion, and thereby identifies where the assumption of a Gaussian likelihood breaks down. Using this diagnostic, we find that non-Gaussian correlations in the CFHTLenS cosmic shear correlation functions are significant. With a simple exclusion of the most contaminated datapoints, the posterior for \$s\_8\$ is shifted without broadening, but we find no significant reduction in the tension with \$s\_8\$ derived from Planck Cosmic Microwave Background data. However, we also show that the one-point distributions of the correlation statistics are noticeably skewed, such that sound weak lensing data sets are intrinsically likely to lead to a systematically low lensing amplitude being inferred. The detected non-Gaussianities get larger with increasing angular scale such that for future wide-angle surveys such as Euclid or LSST, with their very small statistical errors, the large-scale modes are expected to be increasingly affected. The shifts in posteriors may then not be negligible and we recommend that these diagnostic tests be run as part of future analyses.},

  abstract = {The dark energy plus cold dark matter (\$$\backslash$Lambda\$CDM) cosmological model has been a demonstrably successful framework for predicting and explaining the large-scale structure of Universe and its evolution with time. Yet on length scales smaller than \$$\backslash$sim 1\$ Mpc and mass scales smaller than \$$\backslash$sim 10\^\{11\} M\_\{$\backslash$odot\}\$, the theory faces a number of challenges. For example, the observed cores of many dark-matter dominated galaxies are both less dense and less cuspy than naively predicted in \$$\backslash$Lambda\$CDM. The number of small galaxies and dwarf satellites in the Local Group is also far below the predicted count of low-mass dark matter halos and subhalos within similar volumes. These issues underlie the most well-documented problems with \$$\backslash$Lambda\$CDM: Cusp/Core, Missing Satellites, and Too-Big-to-Fail. The key question is whether a better understanding of baryon physics, dark matter physics, or both will be required to meet these challenges. Other anomalies, including the observed planar and orbital configurations of Local Group satellites and the tight baryonic/dark matter scaling relations obeyed by the galaxy population, have been less thoroughly explored in the context of \$$\backslash$Lambda\$CDM theory. Future surveys to discover faint, distant dwarf galaxies and to precisely measure their masses and density structure hold promising avenues for testing possible solutions to the small-scale challenges going forward. Observational programs to constrain or discover and characterize the number of truly dark low-mass halos are among the most important, and achievable, goals in this field over then next decade. These efforts will either further verify the \$$\backslash$Lambda\$CDM paradigm or demand a substantial revision in our understanding of the nature of dark matter.},

  title = {The {{Dependence}} of {{Halo Mass}} on {{Galaxy Size}} at {{Fixed Stellar Mass Using Weak Lensing}}},
  abstract = {Stellar mass has been shown to correlate with halo mass, with non-negligible scatter. The stellar mass-size and luminosity-size relationships of galaxies also show significant scatter in galaxy size at fixed stellar mass. It is possible that, at fixed stellar mass and galaxy colour, the halo mass is correlated with galaxy size. Galaxy-galaxy lensing allows us to measure the mean masses of dark matter haloes for stacked samples of galaxies. We extend the analysis of the galaxies in the CFHTLenS catalogue by fitting single S$\backslash$'\{e\}rsic surface brightness profiles to the lens galaxies in order to recover half-light radius values, allowing us to determine halo masses for lenses according to their size. Comparing our halo masses and sizes to baselines for that stellar mass yields a differential measurement of the halo mass-galaxy size relationship at fixed stellar mass, defined as \$M\_\{h\}(M\_\{*\}) $\backslash$propto r\_\{$\backslash$mathrm\{eff\}\}\^\{$\backslash$eta\}(M\_\{*\})\$. We find that on average, our lens galaxies have an \$$\backslash$eta = 0.42$\backslash$pm0.12\$, i.e. larger galaxies live in more massive dark matter haloes. The \$$\backslash$eta\$ is strongest for high mass luminous red galaxies (LRGs). Investigation of this relationship in hydrodynamical simulations suggests that, at a fixed \$M\_\{*\}\$, satellite galaxies have a larger \$$\backslash$eta\$ and greater scatter in the \$M\_\{$\backslash$mathrm\{h\}\}\$ and \$r\_\{$\backslash$mathrm\{eff\}\}\$ relationship compared to central galaxies.},

  title = {Cosmological Model Discrimination with {{Deep Learning}}},
  abstract = {We demonstrate the potential of Deep Learning methods for measurements of cosmological parameters from density fields, focusing on the extraction of non-Gaussian information. We consider weak lensing mass maps as our dataset. We aim for our method to be able to distinguish between five models, which were chosen to lie along the \$$\backslash$sigma \_8\$ - \$$\backslash$Omega \_m\$ degeneracy, and have nearly the same two-point statistics. We design and implement a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) which learns the relation between five cosmological models and the mass maps they generate. We develop a new training strategy which ensures the good performance of the network for high levels of noise. We compare the performance of this approach to commonly used non-Gaussian statistics, namely the skewness and kurtosis of the convergence maps. We find that our implementation of DCNN outperforms the skewness and kurtosis statistics, especially for high noise levels. The network maintains the mean discrimination efficiency greater than \$85$\backslash$\%\$ even for noise levels corresponding to ground based lensing observations, while the other statistics perform worse in this setting, achieving efficiency less than \$70$\backslash$\%\$. This demonstrates the ability of CNN-based methods to efficiently break the \$$\backslash$sigma \_8\$ - \$$\backslash$Omega \_m\$ degeneracy with weak lensing mass maps alone. We discuss the potential of this method to be applied to the analysis of real weak lensing data and other datasets.},

  abstract = {We analyze scaling relations and evolution histories of galaxy sizes in the TNG100, part of the IllustrisTNG simulation suite. Observational qualitative trends of size with stellar mass, star-formation rate and redshift are reproduced, and a quantitative comparison of projected r-band sizes at 0\textasciitilde{}$<$z$<$\textasciitilde{}2 shows agreement to better than 0.25dex. We follow populations of z=0 galaxies with a range of masses backwards in time along their main progenitor branches, separately for main-sequence and quenched galaxies. Our main findings are as follows. (i) At \$M\_\{*,z=0\}$>$\textasciitilde{}10\^\{9.5\}\$M\$\_$\backslash$odot\$, the main progenitors evolve in different ways, with quenched galaxies hardly growing in median size before quenching, whereas main-sequence galaxies grow their median size continuously, thus opening a gap from the progenitors of quenched galaxies. This is partly because the main-sequence high-redshift progenitors of quenched z=0 galaxies are drawn from the lower end of the size distribution of the overall population of main-sequence high-redshift galaxies. (ii) Quenched galaxies with \$M\_\{*,z=0\}$>$\textasciitilde{}10\^\{9.5\}\$M\$\_$\backslash$odot\$ experience a steep size growth on the size-mass plane after their quenching time, but the size growth rate as a function of time is similar to that of main-sequence galaxies. Hence, the size gap is not closed by z=0. (iii) At all masses but \$M\_\{*,z=0\}$>$10\^\{11\}\$M\$\_$\backslash$odot\$, most of the size (and mass) growth of quenched galaxies occurs while they are still on the main-sequence, and the size variation among quenched galaxies is driven by different degrees of growth on the main-sequence rather than after quenching.},

  abstract = {The average star formation rate (SFR) in galaxies has been declining since redshift of 2. A fraction of galaxies quench and become quiescent. We constrain two key properties of the quenching process: the quenching time scale and the quenching rate among galaxies. We achieve this by analyzing the galaxy number density profile in NUV-u color space and the distribution in NUV-u v.s. u-i color-color diagram with a simple toy-model framework. We focus on galaxies in three mass bins between 10 to 10 and 10 to 10.6 solar mass. In the NUV-u v.s. u-i color-color diagram, the red u-i galaxies exhibit a different slope from the slope traced by the star-forming galaxies. This angled distribution and the number density profile of galaxies in NUV-u space strongly suggest that the decline of the SFR in galaxies has to accelerate before they turn quiescent. We model this color-color distribution with a two-phase exponential decline star formation history. The models with an e-folding time in the second phase (the quenching phase) of 0.5 Gyr best fit the data. We further use the NUV-u number density profile to constrain the quenching rate among star-forming galaxies as a function of mass. Adopting an e-folding time of 0.5 Gyr in the second phase (or the quenching phase), we found the quenching rate to be 19\%/Gyr, 25\%/Gyr and 33\%/Gyr for the three mass bins. These are upper limits of quenching rate as the transition zone could also be populated by rejuvenated red-sequence galaxies.},

  abstract = {Knowledge of galaxy evolution rests on cross-sectional observations of different objects at different times. Understanding of galaxy evolution rests on longitudinal interpretations of how these data relate to individual objects moving through time. The connection between the two is generally assumed to be clear, but we use a simple "physics-free" model to show that it is not and that exploring its nuances can lead to new insights. Comprising nothing more than \$$\backslash$sim2000\$ loosely constrained lognormal star formation histories, the model faithfully reproduces the following data it was never designed to match: stellar mass functions at \$z$\backslash$leq8\$; the slope of the star formation rate/stellar mass relation (the SF "Main Sequence") at \$z$\backslash$leq6\$; the mean \$\{$\backslash$rm sSFR\}($\backslash$equiv\{$\backslash$rm SFR\}/M\_*)\$ of low-mass galaxies at \$z$\backslash$leq7\$; "fast-" and "slow-track quenching"; galaxy downsizing; and a correlation between formation timescale and \$\{$\backslash$rm sSFR\}(M\_*,t)\$ similar to recent results from simulations that provides a natural connection to bulge growth. We take these surprising findings -- which ultimately imply that quenching is the "peeling-off" of the densest tail of the starforming population at any epoch -- to mean either that: (1) models in which galaxies are diversified on long timescales by something akin to initial conditions rival the dominant "grow-and-quench" framework as good descriptions of the data; or (2) cornerstone metrics of galaxy evolution are too information-poor -- if not intrinsically misleading -- to confirm a unique explanation. We outline future tests of our model but stress that, even if it is shown to be incorrect, it illustrates how exploring different evolutionary paradigms can aid learning and, we hope, more detailed modeling efforts.},

  abstract = {We study the implementation of mechanical feedback from supernovae (SNe) and stellar mass loss in galaxy simulations, within the Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE) project. We present the FIRE-2 algorithm for coupling mechanical feedback, which can be applied to any hydrodynamics method (e.g. fixed-grid, moving-mesh, and mesh-less methods), and black hole as well as stellar feedback. This algorithm ensures manifest conservation of mass, energy, and momentum, and avoids imprinting 'preferred directions' on the ejecta. We show that it is critical to incorporate both momentum and thermal energy of mechanical ejecta in a self-consistent manner, accounting for SNe cooling radii when they are not resolved. Using idealized simulations of single SNe explosions, we show that the FIRE-2 algorithm, independent of resolution, reproduces converged solutions in both energy and momentum. In contrast, common 'fully-thermal' (energy-dump) or 'fully-kinetic' (particle-kicking) schemes in the literature depend strongly on resolution: when applied at mass resolution \$$\backslash$gtrsim 100$\backslash$,M\_\{$\backslash$odot\}\$, they diverge by orders-of-magnitude from the converged solution. In galaxy-formation simulations, this divergence leads to orders-of-magnitude differences in galaxy properties, unless those models are adjusted in a resolution-dependent way. We show that all models that individually time-resolve SNe converge to the FIRE-2 solution at sufficiently high resolution (\$$<$100$\backslash$,M\_\{$\backslash$odot\}\$). However, in both idealized single-SNe simulations and cosmological galaxy-formation simulations, the FIRE-2 algorithm converges much faster than other sub-grid models without re-tuning parameters.},

For that reason, it has recently been gaining popularity as an analysis tool in cosmology and astrophysics. Its drawback, however, is a slow convergence rate. We propose a novel method, which we call qABC, to accelerate ABC with Quantile Regression. In this method, we create a model of quantiles of distance measure as a function of input parameters. This model is trained on a small number of simulations and estimates which regions of the prior space are likely to be accepted into the posterior. Other regions are then immediately rejected. This procedure is then repeated as more simulations are available. We apply it to the practical problem of estimation of redshift distribution of cosmological samples, using forward modelling developed in previous work. The qABC method converges to nearly same posterior as the basic ABC. It uses, however, only 20$\backslash$\% of the number of simulations compared to basic ABC, achieving a fivefold gain in execution time for our problem. For other problems the acceleration rate may vary; it depends on how close the prior is to the final posterior. We discuss possible improvements and extensions to this method.},

Over the last 8 Gyrs the quiescent population has grown more slowly in number density at high masses (M\$\_*$>$10\^\{11\}\$M\$\_$\backslash$odot\$) than at intermediate masses (M\$\_*$>$10\^\{10.6\}\$M\$\_$\backslash$odot\$). There is evolution in both the post-starburst and green valley stellar mass functions, consistent with higher mass galaxies quenching at earlier cosmic times. At intermediate masses (M\$\_*$>$10\^\{10.6\}\$M\$\_$\backslash$odot\$) we find a green valley transition timescale of 2.6 Gyr. Alternatively, at \$z$\backslash$sim0.7\$ the entire growth rate could be explained by fast-quenching post-starburst galaxies, with a visibility timescale of 0.5 Gyr. At lower redshift, the number density of post-starbursts is so low that an unphysically short visibility window would be required for them to contribute significantly to the quiescent population growth. The importance of the fast-quenching route may rapidly diminish at \$z$<$1\$. However, at high masses (M\$\_*$>$10\^\{11\}\$M\$\_$\backslash$odot\$), there is tension between the large number of candidate transition galaxies compared to the slow growth of the quiescent population. This could be resolved if not all high mass post-starburst and green-valley galaxies are transitioning from star-forming to quiescent, for example if they rejuvenate out of the quiescent population following the accretion of gas and triggering of star formation, or if they fail to completely quench their star formation.},

  title = {Evolution of {{Galaxy Luminosity}} and {{Stellar}}-{{Mass Functions}} since \$z=1\$ with the {{Dark Energy Survey Science Verification Data}}},
  abstract = {We present the first study of the evolution of the galaxy luminosity and stellar-mass functions (GLF and GSMF) carried out by the Dark Energy Survey (DES). We describe the COMMODORE galaxy catalogue selected from Science Verification images. This catalogue is made of \$$\backslash$sim 4$\backslash$times 10\^\{6\}\$ galaxies at \$0$<$z$\backslash$lesssim1.3\$ over a sky area of \$$\backslash$sim155$\backslash$ \{$\backslash$rm sq. $\backslash$ deg\}\$ with \$\{$\backslash$it i\}\$-band limiting magnitude \$\{$\backslash$it i\}=23$\backslash$ \{$\backslash$rm mag\}\$. Such characteristics are unprecedented for galaxy catalogues and they enable us to study the evolution of GLF and GSMF at \$0$<$z$<$1\$ homogeneously with the same statistically-rich data-set and free of cosmic variance effects. The aim of this study is twofold: i) we want to test our method based on the use of photometric-redshift probability density functions against literature results obtained with spectroscopic redshifts; ii) we want to shed light on the way galaxies build up their masses over cosmic time. We find that both the \$\{$\backslash$it i\}\$-band galaxy luminosity and stellar mass functions are characterised by a double-Schechter shape at \$z$<$0.2\$. Both functions agree well with those based on spectroscopic redshifts. The DES GSMF agrees especially with those measured for the GAlaxy Mass Assembly and the PRism MUlti-object Survey out to \$z$\backslash$sim1\$. At \$0.2$<$z$<$1\$, we find the \$\{$\backslash$it i\}\$-band luminosity and stellar-mass densities respectively to be constant (\$$\backslash$rho\_\{$\backslash$rm L\}$\backslash$propto (1+z)\^\{-0.12$\backslash$pm0.11\}\$) and decreasing (\$$\backslash$rho\_\{$\backslash$rm Mstar\}$\backslash$propto (1+z)\^\{-0.5$\backslash$pm0.1\}\$) with \$z\$. This indicates that, while at higher redshift galaxies have less stellar mass, their luminosities do not change substantially because of their younger and brighter stellar populations. Finally, we also find evidence for a top-down mass-dependent evolution of the GSMF.},

  shorttitle = {{{ELUCID IV}}},
  abstract = {We examine the quenched fraction of central and satellite galaxies as a function of galaxy stellar mass, halo mass, and the matter density of their large scale environment. Matter densities are inferred from our ELUCID simulation, a constrained simulation of the local Universe, sampled by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), while halo masses and the distinction between centrals and satellites are taken from the SDSS galaxy group catalog. The quenched fraction for the total population increases systematically with stellar mass, halo mass, and environmental density. In agreement with previous studies, we find that the `environmental quenching efficiency', which quantifies the quenched fraction as function of environmental density, is independent of stellar mass. This independence also holds when using halo mass as the environmental parameter. And the stellar mass independence of density-based efficiency originates from the independence of halo-based efficiency. We find that centrals and satellites follow similar correlations of quenching efficiency with halo mass and stellar mass, suggesting that they have experienced similar quenching processes. When using mass density as environmental parameter, though, the environmental dependence is much stronger for satellites than for centrals, and the quenching efficiencies of the two populations reveal a significant residual dependence on stellar mass. These are predominantly determined by the fact that centrals and satellites of the same stellar mass on average live in halos of different masses. After removing these halo-mass effects, there is a weak but significant residual in the quenched fraction of central galaxies, which is eliminated when halo assembly bias is taken into account. Our results therefore indicate that halo mass is the prime environmental parameter that regulates the quenching of both centrals and satellites.},

We use the shape of the BOSS redshift-space galaxy power spectrum, in combination with CMB and supernova data, to constrain the neutrino masses and the dark energy. Essential to this calculation are several recent advances in non-linear cosmological perturbation theory, including FFT methods, redshift space distortions, and scale-dependent growth. Our 95\% confidence upper bound of 200 meV on the sum of masses degrades substantially to 770 meV when the dark energy equation of state and its first derivative are also allowed to vary, representing a significant challenge to current constraints. We also study the impact of additional galaxy bias parameters, finding that a velocity bias or a more complicated scale-dependent density bias shift the preferred neutrino mass values 20\%-30\% lower while minimally impacting the other cosmological parameters.},

  abstract = {We present a new model for the redshift-space power spectrum of galaxies and demonstrate its accuracy in modeling the monopole, quadrupole, and hexadecapole of the galaxy density field down to scales of \$k = 0.4 $\backslash$ h$\backslash$mathrm\{Mpc\}\^\{-1\}\$. The model describes the clustering of galaxies in the context of a halo model and the clustering of the underlying halos in redshift space using a combination of Eulerian perturbation theory and \$N\$-body simulations. The modeling of redshift-space distortions is done using the so-called distribution function approach. The final model has 13 free parameters, and each parameter is physically motivated rather than a nuisance parameter, which allows the use of well-motivated priors. We account for the Finger-of-God effect from centrals and both isolated and non-isolated satellites rather than using a single velocity dispersion to describe the combined effect. We test and validate the accuracy of the model on several sets of high-fidelity \$N\$-body simulations, as well as realistic mock catalogs designed to simulate the BOSS DR12 CMASS data set. The suite of simulations covers a range of cosmologies and galaxy bias models, providing a rigorous test of the level of theoretical systematics present in the model. The level of bias in the recovered values of \$f $\backslash$sigma\_8\$ is found to be small. When including scales to \$k = 0.4 $\backslash$ h$\backslash$mathrm\{Mpc\}\^\{-1\}\$, we find 15-30$\backslash$\% gains in the statistical precision of \$f $\backslash$sigma\_8\$ relative to \$k = 0.2 $\backslash$ h$\backslash$mathrm\{Mpc\}\^\{-1\}\$ and a roughly 10-15$\backslash$\% improvement for the perpendicular Alcock-Paczynski parameter \$$\backslash$alpha\_$\backslash$perp\$. Using the BOSS DR12 CMASS mocks as a benchmark for comparison, we estimate an uncertainty on \$f $\backslash$sigma\_8\$ that is \$$\backslash$sim\$10-20$\backslash$\% larger than other similar Fourier-space RSD models in the literature that use \$k $\backslash$leq 0.2 $\backslash$ h$\backslash$mathrm\{Mpc\}\^\{-1\}\$, suggesting that these models likely have a too-limited parametrization.},

  title = {Imprints of {{Reionization}} in {{Galaxy Clustering}}},
  abstract = {Reionization, the only phase transition in the Universe since recombination, is a key event in the cosmic history of baryonic matter. We derive, in the context of the large-scale bias expansion, the imprints of the epoch of reionization in the large-scale distribution of galaxies, and identify two contributions of particular importance. First, the Compton scattering of CMB photons off the free electrons lead to a drag force on the baryon fluid. This drag induces a relative velocity between baryons and CDM which is of the same order of magnitude as the primordially-induced relative velocity, and enters in the evolution of the relative velocity as calculated by Boltzmann codes. This leads to a unique contribution to galaxy bias involving the matter velocity squared. The second important effect is a modulation of the galaxy density by the ionizing radiation field through radiative transfer effects, which is captured in the bias expansion by so-called higher-derivative terms. We constrain both of these imprints using the power spectrum of the BOSS DR12 galaxy sample. While they do not lead to a shift in the baryon acoustic oscillation scale, including these terms is important for unbiased cosmology constraints from the shape of the galaxy power spectrum.},

  title = {Towards Optimal Extraction of Cosmological Information from Nonlinear Data},
  abstract = {One of the main unsolved problems of cosmology is how to maximize the extraction of information from nonlinear data. If the data are nonlinear the usual approach is to employ a sequence of statistics (N-point statistics, counting statistics of clusters, density peaks or voids etc.), along with the corresponding covariance matrices. However, this approach is computationally prohibitive and has not been shown to be exhaustive in terms of information content. Here we instead develop a Bayesian approach, expanding the likelihood around the maximum posterior of linear modes, which we solve for using optimization methods. By integrating out the modes using perturbative expansion of the likelihood we construct an initial power spectrum estimator, which for a fixed forward model contains all the cosmological information if the initial modes are gaussian distributed. We develop a method to construct the window and covariance matrix such that the estimator is explicitly unbiased and nearly optimal. We then generalize the method to include the forward model parameters, including cosmological and nuisance parameters, and primordial non-gaussianity. We apply the method in the simplified context of nonlinear structure formation, using either simplified 2-LPT dynamics or N-body simulations as the nonlinear mapping between linear and nonlinear density, and 2-LPT dynamics in the optimization steps used to reconstruct the initial density modes. We demonstrate that the method gives an unbiased estimator of the initial power spectrum, providing among other a near optimal reconstruction of linear baryonic acoustic oscillations.},

  title = {The Imprint of Neutrinos on Clustering in Redshift-Space},
  abstract = {(abridged) We investigate the signatures left by the cosmic neutrino background on the clustering of matter, CDM+baryons and halos in redshift-space using a set of more than 1000 N-body and hydrodynamical simulations with massless and massive neutrinos. We find that the effect neutrinos induce on the clustering of CDM+baryons in redshift-space on small scales is almost entirely due to the change in \$$\backslash$sigma\_8\$. Neutrinos imprint a characteristic signature in the quadrupole of the matter (CDM+baryons+neutrinos) field on small scales, that can be used to disentangle the effect of \$$\backslash$sigma\_8\$ and \$M\_$\backslash$nu\$. We show that the effect of neutrinos on the clustering of halos is very different, on all scales, to the one induced by \$$\backslash$sigma\_8\$. We find that the effects of neutrinos of the growth rate of CDM+baryons ranges from \$$\backslash$sim0.3$\backslash$\%\$ to \$2$\backslash$\%\$ on scales \$k$\backslash$in[0.01, 0.5]\textasciitilde{}h\{$\backslash$rm Mpc\}\^\{-1\}\$ for neutrinos with masses \$M\_$\backslash$nu $\backslash$leqslant 0.15\$ eV. We compute the bias between the momentum of halos and the momentum of CDM+baryon and find it to be 1 on large scales for all models with massless and massive neutrinos considered. This point towards a velocity bias between halos and total matter on large scales that it is important to account for in order to extract unbiased neutrino information from velocity/momentum surveys such as kSZ observations. We show that baryonic effects can affect the clustering of matter and CDM+baryons in redshift-space by up to a few percent down to \$k=0.5\textasciitilde{}h\{$\backslash$rm Mpc\}\^\{-1\}\$. We find that hydrodynamics and astrophysical processes, as implemented in our simulations, only distort the relative effect that neutrinos induce on the anisotropic clustering of matter, CDM+baryons and halos in redshift-space by less than \$1$\backslash$\%\$. Thus, the effect of neutrinos in the fully non-linear regime can be written as a transfer function with very weak dependence on astrophysics.},

  abstract = {We use stellar mass functions to study the properties and the significance of quenching through major galaxy mergers. In addition to SDSS DR7 and Galaxy Zoo 1 data, we use samples of visually selected major galaxy mergers and post merger galaxies. We determine the stellar mass functions of the stages that we would expect major merger quenched galaxies to pass through on their way from the blue cloud to the red sequence: 1: major merger, 2: post merger, 3: blue early type, 4: green early type and 5: red early type. Based on the similar mass function shapes we conclude that major mergers are likely to form an evolutionary sequence from star formation to quiescence via quenching. Relative to all blue galaxies, the major merger fraction increases as a function of stellar mass. Major merger quenching is inconsistent with the mass and environment quenching model. At z\textasciitilde{}0 major merger quenched galaxies are unlikely to constitute the majority of galaxies that transition the green valley. Furthermore, between z\textasciitilde{}0-0.5 major merger quenched galaxies account for 1-5\% of all quenched galaxies at a given stellar mass. Major galaxy mergers are therefore not a significant quenching pathway, neither at z\textasciitilde{}0 nor within the last 5 Gyr. The majority of red galaxies must have been quenched through an alternative quenching mechanism which causes a slow blue to red evolution.},

However, photospheric velocities are imprinted differently in a high-resolution spectrum than Keplerian Doppler shifts. Photospheric activity produces subtle differences in the shapes of absorption lines due to differences in how temperature or pressure affects the atomic transitions. In contrast, Keplerian Doppler shifts affect every spectral line in the same way. With high enough S/N and high enough resolution, statistical techniques can exploit differences in spectra to disentangle the photospheric velocities and detect lower-amplitude exoplanet signals. We use simulated disk-integrated time-series spectra and principal component analysis (PCA) to show that photospheric signals introduce spectral line variability that is distinct from Doppler shifts.

consistent treatment of theoretical errors and argue that their
inclusion is a necessary step to obtain realistic cosmological
constraints. We find that galaxy surveys up to high redshifts will allow a detection of the minimal neutrino mass and local non-Gaussianity of order unity, but improving the constraints on equilateral
non-Gaussianity beyond the CMB limits will be challenging. We argue that similar considerations apply to analyses where theoretical models are based on simulations.},

  doi = {10.1093/mnras/stx1681},
  abstract = {Over the next decade, improvements in cosmological parameter constraints will be driven by surveys of large-scale structure. Its inherent non-linearity suggests that significant information will be embedded in higher correlations beyond the two-point function. Extracting this information is extremely challenging: it requires accurate theoretical modelling and significant computational resources to estimate the covariance matrix describing correlations between different Fourier configurations. We investigate whether it is possible to reduce the covariance matrix without significant loss of information by using a proxy that aggregates the bispectrum over a subset of Fourier configurations. Specifically, we study the constraints on \$$\backslash$Lambda\$CDM parameters from combining the power spectrum with (a) the modal bispectrum decomposition, (b) the line correlation function and (c) the integrated bispectrum. We forecast the error bars achievable on \$$\backslash$Lambda\$CDM parameters using these proxies in a future galaxy survey and compare them to those obtained from measurements of the Fourier bispectrum, including simple estimates of their degradation in the presence of shot noise. Our results demonstrate that the modal bispectrum performs as well as the Fourier bispectrum, even with considerably fewer modes than Fourier configurations. The line correlation function has good performance but does not match the modal bispectrum. The integrated bispectrum is comparatively insensitive to changes in the background cosmology. We find that adding bispectrum data can improve constraints on bias parameters and the normalization \$$\backslash$sigma\_8\$ by up to 5 compared to power spectrum measurements alone. For other parameters, improvements of up to \$$\backslash$sim\$ 20\% are possible. Finally, we use a range of theoretical models to explore how the sophistication required for realistic predictions varies with each proxy. (abridged)},

  abstract = {The relation between galaxies and dark matter halos reflects the combined effects of many distinct physical processes. Observations indicate that the z = 0 stellar mass-halo mass (SMHM) relation has remarkably small scatter in stellar mass at fixed halo mass ($\lessequivlnt$0.2 dex), with little dependence on halo mass. We investigate the origins of this scatter by combining N-body simulations with observational
constraints on the SMHM relation. We find that at the group and cluster scale (\{M\}\{vir\}$\backslash$gt \{10\}14 \{M\}$\odot$ ) the scatter due purely to hierarchical assembly is $\approx$ 0.16 dex, which is comparable to recent direct observational estimates. At lower masses, mass buildup since z$\approx$ 2 is driven largely by in situ growth. We
include a model for the in situ buildup of stellar mass and find that an intrinsic scatter in this growth channel of 0.2 dex produces a relation between scatter and halo mass that is consistent with observations from \{10\}12 \{M\}$\odot$ $\backslash$lt \{M\}\{vir\}$\backslash$lt
\{10\}14.75 \{M\}$\odot$ . The approximately constant scatter across a wide range of halo masses at z = 0 thus appears to be a coincidence, as it is determined largely by in situ growth at low masses and by hierarchical assembly at high masses. These results indicate that the scatter in the SMHM relation can provide unique insight into the regularity of the galaxy formation process.},

  abstract = {Gladders et al. have recently suggested that the star formation histories (SFHs) of individual galaxies are characterized by a
log-normal function in time, implying a slow decline rather than rapid quenching. We test their conjecture on theoretical SFHs from the cosmological simulation Illustris and on observationally inferred SFHs. While the log-normal form necessarily ignores short-lived features such as starbursts, it fits the overall shape of the majority of SFHs very well. In particular, 85\% of the cumulative SFHs are fitted to within a maximum error of 5\% of the total stellar mass formed, and 99\% to within 10\%. The log-normal performs systematically better than the commonly used delayed-$\tau$ model, and is superseded only by functions with more than three free parameters. Poor fits are mostly found in galaxies that were rapidly quenched after becoming satellites. We explore the
log-normal parameter space of normalization, peak time, and full width at half maximum, and find that the simulated and observed samples occupy similar regions, though Illustris predicts wider, later-forming SFHs on average. The ensemble of log-normal fits correctly reproduces complex metrics such as the evolution of Illustris galaxies across the star formation main sequence, but overpredicts their quenching timescales. SFHs in Illustris are a diverse population not determined by any one physical property of galaxies, but follow a tight relation, where \{width\} $\backslash$propto \{(\{peak\}\{time\})\}3/2. We show that such a relation can be explained qualitatively (though not quantitatively) by a close connection between the growth of dark matter halos and their galaxies.},

  abstract = {We investigate the evolution of the galaxy Star Formation Rate Function (SFRF) and Cosmic Star Formation Rate Density (CSFRD) of \$z$\backslash$sim 0-8 \$ galaxies in the Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies and their Environments (EAGLE) simulations. In addition, we present a compilation of UV, IR and H\$$\backslash$alpha\$ SFRFs and compare these with the predictions from the EAGLE suite of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. We find that the constraints implied by different indicators are inconsistent with each other for the highest star-forming objects at z $<$ 2, a problem that is possibly related to selection biases and the uncertainties of dust attenuation effects. EAGLE's feedback parameters were calibrated to reproduce realistic galaxy sizes and stellar masses at z = 0.1. In this work we test if and why those choices yield realistic Star Formation Rates (SFRs) for \$z $\backslash$sim 0-8\$ as well. We demonstrate that SNe feedback plays a major role at setting the abundance of galaxies at all star-forming regimes, especially at high redshifts. On the contrary, Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) feedback becomes more prominent at lower redshifts and is a major mechanism that affects only the highest star-forming systems. Furthermore, we find that galaxies with SFR \$$\backslash$sim 1-10 $\backslash$, \{$\backslash$rm M\_\{$\backslash$odot\} $\backslash$, yr\^\{-1\}\}\$ dominate the CSFRD at redshifts z $<$ 5, while rare high star-forming galaxies (SFR \$$\backslash$sim 10-100 $\backslash$,\{$\backslash$rm M\_\{$\backslash$odot\} $\backslash$, yr\^\{-1\}\}\$) contribute significantly only briefly around the peak era (\$z $\backslash$sim 2\$) and then are quenched by AGN feedback. In the absence of this prescription objects with SFR \$$\backslash$sim 10-100 $\backslash$,\{$\backslash$rm M\_\{$\backslash$odot\} $\backslash$, yr\^\{-1\}\}\$ would dominate the CSFRD, while the cosmic budget of star formation would be extremely high.

Consequently, there is a diverse range of sphering methods in use, for example based on principal component analysis (PCA), Cholesky matrix decomposition and zero-phase component analysis (ZCA), among others. Here we provide an overview of the underlying theory and discuss five natural whitening procedures. Subsequently, we demonstrate that investigating the cross-covariance and the cross-correlation matrix between sphered and original variables allows to break the rotational invariance and to identify optimal whitening transformations. As a result we recommend two particular approaches: ZCA-cor whitening to produce sphered variables that are maximally similar to the original variables, and PCA-cor whitening to obtain sphered variables that maximally compress the original variables.},

However, photospheric velocities are imprinted differently in a high-resolution spectrum than Keplerian Doppler shifts. Photospheric activity produces subtle differences in the shapes of absorption lines due to differences in how temperature or pressure affects the atomic transitions. In contrast, Keplerian Doppler shifts affect every spectral line in the same way. With high enough S/N and high enough resolution, statistical techniques can exploit differences in spectra to disentangle the photospheric velocities and detect lower-amplitude exoplanet signals. We use simulated disk-integrated time-series spectra and principal component analysis (PCA) to show that photospheric signals introduce spectral line variability that is distinct from Doppler shifts.

  abstract = {Motivated by recent developments in perturbative calculations of the nonlinear evolution of large-scale structure, we present an iterative algorithm to reconstruct the initial conditions in a given volume starting from the dark matter distribution in real space. In our algorithm, objects are first moved back iteratively along estimated potential gradients, with a progressively reduced smoothing scale, until a nearly uniform catalog is obtained. The linear initial density is then estimated as the divergence of the cumulative displacement, with an optional second-order correction. This algorithm should undo nonlinear effects up to one-loop order, including the higher-order infrared resummation piece. We test the method using dark matter simulations in real space. At redshift \$z=0\$, we find that after eight iterations the reconstructed density is more than \$95$\backslash$\%\$ correlated with the initial density at \$k$\backslash$le 0.35$\backslash$; h$\backslash$mathrm\{Mpc\}\^\{-1\}\$. The reconstruction also reduces the power in the difference between reconstructed and initial fields by more than 2 orders of magnitude at \$k$\backslash$le 0.2$\backslash$; h$\backslash$mathrm\{Mpc\}\^\{-1\}\$, and it extends the range of scales where the full broadband shape of the power spectrum matches linear theory by a factor of 2-3. As a specific application, we consider measurements of the baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) scale that can be improved by reducing the degradation effects of large-scale flows. In our idealized dark matter simulations, the method improves the BAO signal-to-noise ratio by a factor of 2.7 at \$z=0\$ and by a factor of 2.5 at \$z=0.6\$, improving standard BAO reconstruction by \$70$\backslash$\%\$ at \$z=0\$ and \$30$\backslash$\%\$ at \$z=0.6\$, and matching the optimal BAO signal and signal-to-noise ratio of the linear density in the same volume. For BAO, the iterative nature of the reconstruction is the most important aspect.},

Their impact on the formation of large scale structure can be used to determine their absolute mass scale from cosmology, but to this end accurate numerical simulations have to be developed. Due to their relativistic nature, neutrinos pose additional challenges when one tries to include them in N-body simulations that are traditionally based on Newtonian physics. Here we present the first numerical study of massive neutrinos that uses a fully relativistic approach. Our N-body code, gevolution, is based on a weak-field formulation of general relativity that naturally provides a self-consistent framework for relativistic particle species. This allows us to model neutrinos from first principles, without invoking any ad-hoc recipes. Our simulation suite comprises some of the largest neutrino simulations performed to date. We study the effect of massive neutrinos on the nonlinear power spectra and the halo mass function, focusing on the interesting mass range between 0.06 eV and 0.3 eV and including a case for an inverted mass hierarchy.},

We apply a method analogous to that of Walker and Penarrubia to a sample of 53 simulated dwarfs and find that this procedure often leads to a statistically significant detection of a core in the profile when in reality there is a cusp. Although multiple factors contribute to these failures, the main cause is a violation of the assumption of spherical symmetry upon which the mass estimators are based. The stellar populations of the simulated dwarfs tend to be significantly elongated and, in several cases, the two metallicity populations have different asphericity and are misaligned. As a result, a wide range of slopes of the density profile are inferred depending on the angle from which the galaxy is viewed.},

  title = {On Stellar Mass Loss from Galaxies in Groups and Clusters},
  abstract = {We estimate the stellar mass that satellite galaxies lose once they enter groups (and clusters) by identifying groups in a high-resolution cosmological N-body simulation, assigning entry masses to satellite galaxies with halo abundance matching at the entry time, and comparing the predicted conditional stellar mass function of satellite galaxies at \$z$\backslash$simeq0\$ with observations. Our results depend on the mass of the stars that form in satellite galaxies after the entry time. A model in which star formation shuts down completely as soon a galaxy enters a group environment is ruled out because it underpredicts the stellar masses of satellite galaxies even in the absence of tidal stripping. The greater is the stellar mass that is allowed to form, the greater the fraction that needs to be tidally stripped. The stellar mass fraction lost by satellite galaxies after entering a group or cluster environment is consistent with any value in the range \$0-40$\backslash$\%\$. To place stronger constraints, we consider a more refined model of tidal stripping of galaxies on elongated orbits (where stripping occurs at orbit pericentres). Our model predicts less tidal stripping: satellite galaxies lose \$$\backslash$sim 20-25$\backslash$\%\$ of their stellar mass since their entry into the group. This finding is consistent with a slow-starvation delayed-quenching picture, in which galaxies that enter a group or cluster environment keep forming stars until at least the first pericentric passage.},

  title = {Cosmic Shear Calibration with Forward Modeling},
  abstract = {Weak Gravitational Lensing is a powerful probe of the dark sector of the Universe. One of the main challenges for this technique is the treatment of systematics in the measurement of cosmic shear from galaxy shapes. In an earlier work, Refregier \& Amara (2014) have proposed the Monte Carlo Control Loops (MCCL) to overcome these effects using a forward modeling approach. We focus here on one of the control loops in this method, the task of which is the calibration of the shear measurement. For this purpose, we first consider the requirements on the shear systematics for a given survey and propagate them to different systematics terms. We use two one-point statistics to calibrate the shear measurement and six further one-point statistics as diagnostics. We also propagate the systematics levels that we estimate from the one-point functions to the two-point functions for the different systematic error sources. This allows us to assess the consistency between the systematics levels measured in different ways. To test the method, we construct synthetic sky surveys with an area of 1,700 deg\$\^2\$. With some simplifying assumptions, we are able to meet the requirements on the shear calibration for this survey configuration. Furthermore, we account for the total residual shear systematics in terms of the contributing sources. We discuss how this MCCL framework can be applied to current and future weak lensing surveys.},

  title = {What Sets the Central Structure of Dark Matter Haloes?},
  abstract = {Dark matter (DM) haloes forming near the thermal cut-off scale of the density perturbations are unique, since they are the smallest objects and form through monolithic gravitational collapse, while larger haloes contrastingly have experienced mergers. While standard cold dark matter simulations readily produce haloes that follow the universal Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) density profile with an inner slope, \$$\backslash$rho $\backslash$propto r\^\{-$\backslash$alpha\}\$, with \$$\backslash$alpha=1\$, recent simulations have found that when the free-streaming cut-off is resolved, the resulting haloes follow nearly power-law density profiles of \$$\backslash$alpha$\backslash$sim1.5\$. In this paper, we study the formation of density cusps in haloes using idealized \$N\$-body simulations of the collapse of proto-haloes. When the proto-halo profile is initially cored due to particle free-streaming at high redshift, we universally find \$$\backslash$sim r\^\{-1.5\}\$ profiles irrespective of the proto-halo profile slope outside the core and large-scale non-spherical perturbations. Quite in contrast, when the proto-halo has a power-law profile, then we obtain profiles compatible with the NFW shape when the density slope of the proto-halo patch is shallower than a critical value, \$$\backslash$alpha\_\{$\backslash$rm ini\} $\backslash$sim 0.3\$, while the final slope can be steeper for \$$\backslash$alpha\_\{$\backslash$rm ini\}$\backslash$gtrsim 0.3\$. We further demonstrate that the \$r\^\{-1.5\}\$ profiles are sensitive to small scale noise, which gradually drives them towards an inner slope of \$-1\$, where they become resilient to such perturbations. We demonstrate that the \$r\^\{-1.5\}\$ solutions are in hydrostatic equilibrium, largely consistent with a simple analytic model, and provide arguments that angular momentum appears to determine the inner slope.},

  abstract = {We measure the clustering of DES Year 1 galaxies that are intended to be combined with weak lensing samples in order to produce precise cosmological constraints from the joint analysis of large-scale structure and lensing correlations. Two-point correlation functions are measured for a sample of \$6.6 $\backslash$times 10\^\{5\}\$ luminous red galaxies selected using the $\backslash$textsc\{redMaGiC\} algorithm over an area of \$1321\$ square degrees, in the redshift range \$0.15 $<$ z $<$ 0.9\$, split into five tomographic redshift bins. The sample has a mean redshift uncertainty of \$$\backslash$sigma\_\{z\}/(1+z) = 0.017\$. We quantify and correct spurious correlations induced by spatially variable survey properties, testing their impact on the clustering measurements and covariance. We demonstrate the sample's robustness by testing for stellar contamination, for potential biases that could arise from the systematic correction, and for the consistency between the two-point auto- and cross-correlation functions. We show that the corrections we apply have a significant impact on the resultant measurement of cosmological parameters, but that the results are robust against arbitrary choices in the correction method. We find the linear galaxy bias in each redshift bin in a fiducial cosmology to be \$b(z\$=\$0.24)=1.40 $\backslash$pm 0.08\$, \$b(z\$=\$0.38)=1.61 $\backslash$pm 0.05\$, \$b(z\$=\$0.53)=1.60 $\backslash$pm 0.04\$ for galaxies with luminosities \$L/L\_*$>$\$\$0.5\$, \$b(z\$=\$0.68)=1.93 $\backslash$pm 0.05\$ for \$L/L\_*$>$\$\$1\$ and \$b(z\$=\$0.83)=1.99 $\backslash$pm 0.07\$ for \$L/L\_*\$\$$>$1.5\$, broadly consistent with expectations for the redshift and luminosity dependence of the bias of red galaxies. We show these measurements to be consistent with the linear bias obtained from tangential shear measurements.},

We find that the baryonic processes have almost no impact on large-scale structures -- at least not when classified using aforementioned techniques. More importantly, our results confirm that the gas component alone can be used to infer the filamentary structure of the Universe practically un-biased, which could be applied to cosmology constrains. In addition, the gas filaments are classified with its velocity and density fields, which can theoretically connect to the radio observations, such as HI surveys. This will help us to bias-freely link the radio observations with dark matter distributions at large scale.},

  abstract = {We measure how the properties of star-forming central galaxies correlate with large-scale environment, \$$\backslash$delta\$, measured on \$10\$Mpc/h scales. We use group catalogs to isolate a robust sample of central galaxies with high purity and completeness. The properties we investigate are star formation rate (SFR), exponential disk scale length \$R\_\{$\backslash$rm exp\}\$, and Sersic index of the light profile, \$n\$. We find that, at all stellar masses, there is an inverse correlation between SFR and \$$\backslash$delta\$, meaning that above-average star forming centrals live in underdense regions. For \$n\$ and \$R\_\{$\backslash$rm exp\}\$, there is no correlation with \$$\backslash$delta\$ at \$M\_\{$\backslash$rm star\}$\backslash$lesssim 10\^\{10.5\}\$ \$M\_$\backslash$odot\$, but at higher masses there are positive correlations; a weak correlation with \$R\_\{$\backslash$rm exp\}\$ and a strong correlation with \$n\$. These data are evidence of assembly bias within the star-forming population. The results for SFR are consistent with a model in which SFR correlates with present-day halo accretion rate, \$$\backslash$dot\{M\}\_h\$. In this model, galaxies are assigned to halos using the abundance matching ansatz, which maps galaxy stellar mass onto halo mass. At fixed halo mass, SFR is assigned to galaxies using the same approach,but \$$\backslash$dot\{M\}\_h\$ is used to map onto SFR. The best-fit model requires some scatter in the \$$\backslash$dot\{M\}\_h\$-SFR relation. The \$R\_\{$\backslash$rm exp\}\$ and \$n\$ measurements are consistent with a model in which these quantities are correlated with the spin parameter of the halo, \$$\backslash$lambda\$. Halo spin does not correlate with \$$\backslash$delta\$ at low halo masses, but for higher mass halos, high-spin halos live in higher density environments at fixed \$M\_h\$. Put together with the earlier installments of this series, these data demonstrate that quenching processes have limited correlation with halo formation history, but the growth of active galaxies, as well as other detailed properties, are influenced by the details of halo assembly.},

  shorttitle = {Accurate {{Modelling}} of {{Galaxy Clustering}} on {{Small Scales}}},
  abstract = {Interpreting the small-scale clustering of galaxies with halo models can elucidate the connection between galaxies and dark matter halos. Unfortunately, the modelling is typically not sufficiently accurate for ruling out models in a statistical sense. It is thus difficult to use the information encoded in small scales to test cosmological models or probe subtle features of the galaxy-halo connection. In this paper, we attempt to push halo modelling into the "accurate" regime with a fully numerical mock-based methodology and careful treatment of statistical and systematic errors. An advantage of this approach is that it can easily incorporate clustering statistics beyond the traditional two-point statistics. We use this modelling methodology to test the standard \$$\backslash$Lambda$\backslash$mathrm\{CDM\}\$ + halo model against the clustering of SDSS DR7 galaxies. Specifically, we use the projected correlation function, group multiplicity function and galaxy number density as constraints. We find that while the model provides a good match to each statistic separately, it struggles to fit them jointly. Adding group statistics leads to a more stringent test of the model and significantly tighter constraints on model parameters. We explore the impact of varying the adopted halo definition and cosmological model and find that changing the cosmology makes a significant difference. The most successful model we tried (Planck cosmology with Mvir halos) matches the clustering of low luminosity galaxies, but exhibits a \$2.3 $\backslash$sigma\$ tension with the clustering of luminous galaxies, thus providing evidence that the "standard" halo model needs to be extended. This work represents the most accurate modelling of small-scale clustering to-date and opens the door to adding interesting freedom to the halo model and including additional clustering statistics as constraints.},

  abstract = {In order to best improve constraints on cosmological parameters and on models of modified gravity using current and future galaxy surveys it is necessary maximally exploit the available data. As redshift-space distortions mean statistical translation invariance is broken for galaxy observations, this will require measurement of the monopole, quadrupole and hexadecapole of not just the galaxy power spectrum, but also the galaxy bispectrum. A recent (2015) paper by Scoccimarro demonstrated how the standard bispectrum estimator may be expressed in terms of Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs) to afford an extremely efficient algorithm, allowing the bispectrum multipoles on all scales and triangle shapes to be measured in comparable time to those of the power spectrum. In this paper we present a suite of alternative proxies to measure the three-point correlation multipoles. In particular, we describe a modal (or plane wave) decomposition to capture the information in each multipole in a series of basis coefficients, and also describe three compressed estimators formed using the skew-spectrum, the line correlation function and the integrated bispectrum, respectively. As well as each of the estimators offering a different measurement channel, and thereby a robustness check, it is expected that some (especially the modal estimator) will offer a vast data compression, and so a much reduced covariance matrix. This compression may be vital to reduce the computational load involved in extracting the available three-point information.},

  title = {The Host Dark Matter Halos of [{{OII}}] Emitters at 0.5$<$ Z$<$ 1.5},
  abstract = {Emission line galaxies (ELGs) are used in several ongoing and upcoming surveys as tracers of the dark matter distribution. Using a new galaxy formation model, we explore the characteristics of [OII] emitters, which dominate optical ELG selections at \$z$\backslash$simeq 1\$. Model [OII] emitters at \$0.5$<$z$<$1.5\$ are selected to mimic the DEEP2, VVDS, eBOSS and DESI surveys. The luminosity functions of model [OII] emitters are in reasonable agreement with observations. The selected [OII] emitters are hosted by haloes with \$M\_\{$\backslash$rm halo\}$\backslash$geq 10\^\{10.5\}h\^\{-1\}\{$\backslash$rm M\}\_\{$\backslash$odot\}\$, with \$$\backslash$sim 90\$\% of them being central star-forming galaxies. The predicted mean halo occupation distributions of [OII] emitters has a shape typical of that inferred for star-forming galaxies, with the contribution from central galaxies, \$$<$N$>$\_\{[OII],cen\}\$, being far from the canonical step function. The \$$<$N$>$\_\{[OII],cen\}\$ can be described as the sum of an asymmetric Gaussian for disks and a step function for spheroids, which plateaus below unity. The model [OII] emitters have a clustering bias close to unity, which is below the expectations for eBOSS and DESI ELGs. At \$z$\backslash$sim 1\$, a comparison with observed g-band selected galaxy, which are expected to be dominated by [OII] emitters, indicates that our model produces too few [OII] emitters that are satellite galaxies. This suggests the need to revise our modelling of hot gas stripping in satellite galaxies.},

  title = {Stellar {{Mass Function}} of {{Active}} and {{Quiescent Galaxies}} via the {{Continuity Equation}}},
  abstract = {The continuity equation is developed for the stellar mass content of galaxies, and exploited to derive the stellar mass function of active and quiescent galaxies over the redshift range \$z$\backslash$sim 0-8\$. The continuity equation requires two specific inputs gauged on observations: (i) the star formation rate functions determined on the basis of the latest UV+far-IR/sub-mm/radio measurements; (ii) average star-formation histories for individual galaxies, with different prescriptions for discs and spheroids. The continuity equation also includes a source term taking into account (dry) mergers, based on recent numerical simulations and consistent with observations. The stellar mass function derived from the continuity equation is coupled with the halo mass function and with the SFR functions to derive the star formation efficiency and the main sequence of star-forming galaxies via the abundance matching technique. A remarkable agreement of the resulting stellar mass function for active and quiescent galaxies, of the galaxy main sequence and of the star-formation efficiency with current observations is found; the comparison with data also allows to robustly constrain the characteristic timescales for star formation and quiescence of massive galaxies, the star formation history of their progenitors, and the amount of stellar mass added by in-situ star formation vs. that contributed by external merger events. The continuity equation is shown to yield quantitative outcomes that must be complied by detailed physical models, that can provide a basis to improve the (sub-grid) physical recipes implemented in theoretical approaches and numerical simulations, and that can offer a benchmark for forecasts on future observations with multi-band coverage, as it will become routinely achievable in the era of JWST.},

  title = {The Impact of Galaxy Formation on Satellite Kinematics and Redshift-Space Distortions},
  abstract = {Galaxy surveys aim to map the large-scale structure of the Universe and use redshift space distortions to constrain deviations from general relativity and to probe the existence of mas- sive neutrinos. However, the amount of information that can be extracted will be limited by the accuracy of theoretical models used to analyze the data. Here, by using the L-Galaxies semi-analytical model run over the MXXL N-body simulation, we assess the impact of galaxy formation on satellite kinematics and the theoretical modelling of redshift-space distortions. We show that different galaxy selection criteria lead to noticeable differences in the radial distributions and velocity structure of satellite galaxies. Specifically, whereas samples of stel- lar mass selected galaxies feature satellites that roughly follow the dark matter, emission line satellite galaxies are located preferentially in the outskirts of halos and display net infall veloc- ities. We demonstrate that capturing these differences is crucial for modelling the multipoles of the correlation function in redshift space, even on large scales. In particular, we show how modelling small scale velocities with a single Gaussian distribution leads to a poor description of the measure clustering. In contrast, we propose a parametrization that is flexible enough to model the satellite kinematics, and that leads to and accurate description of the correlation function down to sub-Mpc scales. We anticipate that our model will be a necessary ingredient in improved theoretical descriptions of redshift space distortions, which together could result in a significantly tighter on cosmological constraints and more optimal exploitation of future large datasets.},

  shorttitle = {Spatial {{Clustering}} of {{Dark Matter Halos}}},
  abstract = {We explore the phenomenon commonly known as halo assembly bias, whereby dark matter halos of the same mass are found to be more or less clustered when a second halo property is considered, for halos in the mass range \$3.7 $\backslash$times 10\^\{11\} $\backslash$; h\^\{-1\} $\backslash$mathrm\{M\_\{$\backslash$odot\}\} - 5.0 $\backslash$times 10\^\{13\} $\backslash$; h\^\{-1\} $\backslash$mathrm\{M\_\{$\backslash$odot\}\}\$. Using the Large Suite of Dark Matter Simulations (LasDamas) we consider nine commonly used halo properties and find that a clustering bias exists if halos are binned by mass or by any other halo property. This secondary bias implies that no single halo property encompasses all the spatial clustering information of the halo population. The mean values of some halo properties depend on their halo's distance to a more massive neighbor. Halo samples selected by having high values of one of these properties therefore inherit a neighbor bias such that they are much more likely to be close to a much more massive neighbor. This neighbor bias largely accounts for the secondary bias seen in halos binned by mass and split by concentration or age. However, halos binned by other mass-like properties still show a secondary bias even when the neighbor bias is removed. The secondary bias of halos selected by their spin behaves differently than that for other halo properties, suggesting that the origin of the spin bias is different than of other secondary biases.},

* $>$\textasciitilde{} 1010.6 M $\odot$, our results
indicate that star-forming galaxies grow proportionately as fast as
their dark matter halos while quiescent galaxies are outpaced by dark
matter growth. At lower masses, there is minimal difference in the
SHMRs, implying that the majority low-mass quiescent galaxies have only
recently been quenched of their star formation. Our analysis also
affords a breakdown of all COSMOS galaxies into the relative numbers of
central and satellite galaxies for both populations. At z = 1, satellite
galaxies dominate the red sequence below the knee in the stellar mass
function. But the number of quiescent satellites exhibits minimal
redshift evolution; all evolution in the red sequence is due to low-mass
central galaxies being quenched of their star formation. At M
* \textasciitilde{} 1010 M $\odot$, the fraction of
central galaxies on the red sequence increases by a factor of 10 over
our redshift baseline, while the fraction of quenched satellite galaxies
at that mass is constant with redshift. We define a "migration rate" to
the red sequence as the time derivative of the passive galaxy
abundances. We find that the migration rate of central galaxies to the
red sequence increases by nearly an order of magnitude from z = 1 to z =
0. These results imply that the efficiency of quenching star formation
for centrals is increasing with cosmic time, while the mechanisms that
quench the star formation of satellite galaxies in groups and clusters
is losing efficiency.},

  abstract = {We compare reduced three-point correlations \$Q\$ of matter, haloes (as proxies for galaxies) and their cross correlations, measured in a total simulated volume of \$$\backslash$sim100 $\backslash$ (h\^\{-1\} $\backslash$text\{Gpc\})\^\{3\}\$, to predictions from leading order perturbation theory on a large range of scales in configuration space. Predictions for haloes are based on the non-local bias model, employing linear (\$b\_1\$) and non-linear (\$c\_2\$, \$g\_2\$) bias parameters, which have been constrained previously from the bispectrum in Fourier space. We also study predictions from two other bias models, one local (\$g\_2=0\$) and one in which \$c\_2\$ and \$g\_2\$ are determined by \$b\_1\$ via an approximately universal relation. Overall, measurements and predictions agree when \$Q\$ is derived for triangles with \$(r\_1r\_2r\_3)\^\{1/3\} $\backslash$gtrsim 60 h\^\{-1\}$\backslash$text\{Mpc\}\$, where \$r\_\{1-3\}\$ are the sizes of the triangle legs. Predictions for \$Q\_\{matter\}\$, based on the linear power spectrum, show significant deviations from the measurements at the BAO scale (given our small measurement errors), which strongly decrease when adding a damping term or using the non-linear power spectrum, as expected. Predictions for \$Q\_\{halo\}\$ agree best with measurements at large scales when considering non-local contributions. The universal bias model works well for haloes and might therefore be also useful for tightening constraints on \$b\_1\$ from \$Q\$ in galaxy surveys. Such constraints are independent of the amplitude of matter density fluctuation (\$$\backslash$sigma\_8\$) and hence break the degeneracy between \$b\_1\$ and \$$\backslash$sigma\_8\$, present in galaxy two-point correlations.},

  abstract = {We present here a simple model for the star formation history (SFH) of 
galaxies that is successful in describing both the star formation rate
density (SFRD) over cosmic time, as well as the distribution of specific
star formation rates (sSFRs) of galaxies at the current epoch, and the
evolution of this quantity in galaxy populations to a redshift of z = 1.
We show first that the cosmic SFRD is remarkably well described by a
simple log-normal in time. We next postulate that this functional form
for the ensemble is also a reasonable description for the SFHs of
individual galaxies. Using the measured sSFRs for galaxies at z \textasciitilde{} 0 from
Paper III in this series, we then construct a realization of a universe
populated by such galaxies in which the parameters of the log-normal SFH
of each galaxy are adjusted to match the sSFRs at z \textasciitilde{} 0 as well as
fitting, in ensemble, the cosmic SFRD from z = 0 to z = 8. This model
predicts, with striking fidelity, the distribution of sSFRs in
mass-limited galaxy samples to z = 1; this match is not achieved by
other models with a different functional form for the SFHs of individual
galaxies, but with the same number of degrees of freedom, suggesting
that the log-normal form is well matched to the likely actual histories
of individual galaxies. We also impose the sSFR versus mass
distributions at higher redshifts from Paper III as constraints on the
model, and show that, as previously suggested, some galaxies in the
field, particularly low mass galaxies, are quite young at intermediate
redshifts. As emphasized in Paper III, starbursts are insufficient to
explain the enhanced sSFRs in intermediate redshift galaxies; we show
here that a model using only smoothly varying log-normal SFHs for
galaxies, which allows for some fraction of the population to have peak
star formation at late times, does however fully explain the
observations. Finally, we show that this model, constrained in detail
only at redshifts z $<$ 1, also produces the main sequence of
star-formation observed at 1.5 $<$ z $<$ 2.5, again suggesting that
the log-normal SFHs are a close approximation to the actual histories of
typical galaxies.},

  shorttitle = {Dark Matter Statistics for Large Galaxy Catalogs},
  abstract = {Upcoming and existing large-scale surveys of galaxies require accurate theoretical predictions of the dark matter clustering statistics for thousands of mock galaxy catalogs. We demonstrate that this goal can be achieve with our new Parallel Particle-Mesh (PM) Nbody code (PPM-GLAM) at a very low computational cost. We run about 15,000 simulations with \textasciitilde{}2 billion particles that provide \textasciitilde{}1\% accuracy of the dark matter power spectra P(k) for wave-numbers up to k\textasciitilde{} 1h/Mpc. Using this large data-set we study the power spectrum covariance matrix, the stepping stone for producing mock catalogs. In contrast to many previous analytical and numerical results, we find that the covariance matrix normalised to the power spectrum C(k,k')/P(k)P(k') has a complex structure of non-diagonal components. It has an upturn at small k, followed by a minimum at k=0.1-0.2h/Mpc. It also has a maximum at k=0.5-0.6h/Mpc. The normalised covariance matrix strongly evolves with redshift: C(k,k')\textasciitilde{}delta(t)\^alpha P(k)P(k'), where delta is the linear growth factor and alpha \textasciitilde{} 1-1.25, which indicates that the covariance matrix depends on cosmological parameters. We also show that waves longer than 1Gpc have very little impact on the power spectrum and covariance matrix. This significantly reduces the computational costs and complexity of theoretical predictions: relatively small volume \textasciitilde{} (1Gpc)\^3 simulations capture the necessary properties of dark matter clustering statistics. All the power spectra obtained from many thousands of our simulations are publicly available.},

This leads to a likelihood function that is no longer Gaussian, but rather an adapted version of a multivariate t-distribution, which has the same numerical complexity as the multivariate Gaussian. As expected, marginalization over the true covariance matrix improves inference when compared with Hartlap et al.'s method, which uses an unbiased estimate of the inverse covariance matrix but still assumes that the likelihood is Gaussian.},

We confirm that both \$f\_$\backslash$mathrm\{H\_2\}\$ and SFE have strong positive correlations with the SFR offset from the star-forming main sequence (\$$\backslash$Delta\$MS), and most importantly, we find that these correlations are universal across all environments. Our result demonstrates that star-formation activity within individual galaxies is primarily controlled by their molecular gas content, regardless of their global environment.

  title = {The Limited Role of Galaxy Mergers in Driving Stellar Mass Growth over Cosmic Time},
  abstract = {A key unresolved question is the role that galaxy mergers play in driving stellar mass growth over cosmic time. Recent observational work hints at the possibility that the overall contribution of `major' mergers (mass ratios \$$\backslash$gtrsim\$1:4) to cosmic stellar mass growth may be small, because they enhance star formation rates by relatively small amounts at high redshift, when much of today's stellar mass was assembled. However, the heterogeneity and relatively small size of today's datasets, coupled with the difficulty in identifying genuine mergers, makes it challenging to \$$\backslash$textit\{empirically\}\$ quantify the merger contribution to stellar mass growth. Here, we use Horizon-AGN, a cosmological hydrodynamical simulation, to comprehensively quantify the contribution of mergers to the star formation budget over the lifetime of the Universe. We show that: (1) both major and minor mergers enhance star formation to similar amounts, (2) the fraction of star formation directly attributable to merging is small at all redshifts (e.g. \$$\backslash$sim\$35 and \$$\backslash$sim\$20 per cent at z\$$\backslash$sim\$3 and z\$$\backslash$sim\$1 respectively) and (3) only \$$\backslash$sim\$25 per cent of today's stellar mass is directly attributable to galaxy mergers over cosmic time. Our results suggest that smooth accretion, not merging, is the dominant driver of stellar mass growth over the lifetime of the Universe.},

  doi = {10.1111/j.1365-2966.2004.07530.x},
  abstract = {It is widely believed that maximum-likelihood estimators must be used to 
provide optimal estimates of power spectra. Since such estimators
require the inversion and multiplication of
Nd\texttimes{}Nd matrices, where Nd is the
size of the data vector, maximum-likelihood estimators require at least
of order N3d operations and become computationally
prohibitive for Nd greater than a few tens of thousands.
Because of this, a large and inhomogeneous literature exists on
approximate methods of power-spectrum estimation. These range from
manifestly suboptimal but computationally fast methods, to near-optimal
but computationally expensive methods. Furthermore, much of this
literature concentrates on the power-spectrum estimates rather than the
equally important problem of deriving an accurate covariance matrix. In
this paper, I consider the problem of estimating the power spectrum of
cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies from large data sets.
Various analytic results on power-spectrum estimators are derived, or
collated from the literature, and tested against numerical simulations.
An unbiased hybrid estimator is proposed that combines a
maximum-likelihood estimator at low multipoles and pseudo-Cl
estimates at high multipoles. The hybrid estimator is computationally
fast (i.e. it can be run on a laptop computer for Planck-sized data
sets), nearly optimal over the full range of multipoles, and returns an
accurate and nearly diagonal covariance matrix for realistic
experimental configurations (provided certain conditions on the noise
properties of the experiment are satisfied). It is argued that, in
practice, computationally expensive methods that approximate the
maximum-likelihood solution are unlikely to improve on the hybrid
estimator, and may actually perform worse. The results presented here
can be generalized to CMB polarization and to power-spectrum estimation
using other types of data, such as galaxy clustering and weak
gravitational lensing.},

Finally, we derive the probability distribution function using integration by residues. We use a numerical implementation of the full analytic formula to discuss the behaviour of this function. Results: We derive the univariate and bivariate probability distribution function of the correlation functions of a Gaussian random field, and outline how higher joint distributions could be calculated. We give the results in the form of mode expansions, but in one special case we also find a closed-form expression. We calculate the moments of the distribution and, in the univariate case, we discuss the Edgeworth expansion approximation.

  abstract = {Measurements of correlation functions and their comparison with theoretical models are often employed in natural sciences, including astrophysics and cosmology, to determine best-fitting model parameters and their confidence regions. Due to a lack of better descriptions, the likelihood function of the correlation function is often assumed to be a multi-variate Gaussian. Using different methods, we show that
correlation functions have to satisfy constraint relations, owing to the non-negativity of the power spectrum of the underlying random process. Specifically, for any statistically homogeneous and (for more than one spatial dimension) isotropic random field with correlation function $\xi$(x), we derive inequalities for the correlation coefficients
r\_n$\equiv$ $\xi$(n x)/$\xi$(0) (for integer n) of the form
rnl$\leq$ r\_n$\leq$ rnu, where the lower and upper
bounds on rn depend on the r\_j, with jn-\{ $\xi$(0),$\xi$(x),
$\xi$(2x),dots,$\xi$([n-1]x) \}$\leq$ $\xi$(n x) $\leq$ $\Xi$n+\{
$\xi$(0),$\xi$(x), $\xi$(2x),dots,$\xi$([n-1]x) \}. Explicit expressions for
the bounds are obtained for arbitrary n. We show that these constraint equations very significantly limit the set of possible correlation functions. For one particular example of a fiducial cosmic shear survey, we show that the Gaussian likelihood ellipsoid has a significant spill-over into the region of correlation functions forbidden by the aforementioned constraints, rendering the resulting best-fitting model parameters and their error region questionable, and indicating the need for a better description of the likelihood function. We conduct some simple numerical experiments which explicitly demonstrate the failure of a Gaussian description for the likelihood of $\xi$. Instead, the shape of the likelihood function of the correlation coefficients appears to follow approximately the shape of the bounds on the r\_n, even if the Gaussian ellipsoid lies well within the allowed region. Therefore, we define a non-linear and coupled transformation of the r\_n, based on these bounds. Some numerical experiments then indicate that a Gaussian is a much better description of the likelihood in these transformed variables than of the original correlation coefficients - in particular, the full probability distribution then lies explicitly in the allowed region. For more than one spatial dimension of the random field, the explicit expressions of the bounds on the rn are not optimal. We outline a geometrical method how tighter bounds may be obtained in principle. We illustrate this method for a few simple cases; a more general treatment awaits future work.},

shear likelihood. We estimate the true likelihood for a fiducial
cosmological model from a large set of ray-tracing simulations and
investigate the impact of non-Gaussianity on cosmological parameter

of $\sigma$8 really is as derived from the Chandra Deep Field
South (CDFS) using cosmic shear by taking the non-Gaussianity of the
likelihood into account, as well as the possibility of biases coming
from the way the CDFS was selected. Methods: A brute force
approach to estimating the likelihood from simulations must fail because
of the high dimensionality of the problem. We therefore use independent
component analysis to transform the cosmic shear correlation functions
to a new basis, in which the likelihood approximately factorises into a
product of one-dimensional distributions. Results: We find that
the cosmic shear likelihood is significantly non-Gaussian. This leads to
both a shift of the maximum of the posterior distribution and a
significantly smaller credible region compared to the Gaussian case. We
re-analyse the CDFS cosmic shear data using the non-Gaussian likelihood
in combination with conservative galaxy selection criteria that minimise
calibration uncertainties. Assuming that the CDFS is a random pointing,
we find $\sigma$\_8=0.68-0.16+0.09 for fixed
$\Omega$\_m=0.25. In a WMAP5-like cosmology, a value equal to or lower
than this would be expected in $\approx$ 5\% of the times. Taking biases into
account arising from the way the CDFS was selected, which we model as
being dependent on the number of haloes in the CDFS, we obtain
$\sigma$8 = 0.71+0.10-0.15. Combining
the CDFS data with the parameter constraints from WMAP5 yields

  abstract = {Context: In cosmic shear likelihood analyses, the covariance is most 
commonly assumed to be constant in parameter space. Therefore, when
calculating the covariance matrix (analytically or from simulations),
its underlying cosmology should not influence the likelihood contours.
Aims: We examine whether the aforementioned assumptions hold and
quantify how strong cosmic shear covariances vary within a reasonable
parameter range. Furthermore, we examine the impact on likelihood
contours when assuming different cosmologies in the covariance. The
final goal is to develop an improved likelihood analysis for parameter
estimation with cosmic shear. Methods: We calculate Gaussian
covariances analytically for 2500 different cosmologies. To quantify the
impact on the parameter constraints, we perform a likelihood analysis
for each covariance matrix and compare the likelihood contours. To
improve on the assumption of a constant covariance, we use an adaptive
covariance matrix, which is continuously updated according to the point
in parameter space where the likelihood is evaluated. As a side-effect,
this cosmology-dependent covariance improves the parameter constraints.
We examine this more closely using the Fisher-matrix formalism. In
addition, we quantify the impact of non-Gaussian covariances on the
likelihood contours using a ray-tracing covariance derived from the
Millennium simulation. In this ansatz, we return to the approximation of
a cosmology-independent covariance matrix, and to minimize the error due
to this approximation, we develop the concept of an iterative likelihood
analysis. Results: Covariances vary significantly within the
considered parameter range. The cosmology assumed in the covariance has
a non-negligible impact on the size of the likelihood contours. This
impact increases with increasing survey size, increasing number density
of source galaxies, decreasing ellipticity noise, and when taking
non-Gaussianity into account. A proper treatment of this effect is
therefore even more important for future surveys. In this paper, we
present methods for taking cosmology-dependent covariances into account.},

By splitting each galaxy into an inner and an outer part, we find that most galaxies show negative gradients in these two colours. We first rule out dust extinction gradient and metallicity gradient as the dominant source for the colour gradient. Then using stellar population models, we explore variations in star formation history to explain the colour gradients. As shown by our earlier work, a two-phase SFH consisting of an early secular evolution (growth) phase and a subsequent rapid evolution (quenching) phase is necessary to explain the observed colour distributions among galaxies. We explore two different inside-out growth models and two different inside-out quenching models by varying parameters of the SFH between inner and outer regions of galaxies. Two of the models can explain the observed range of colour gradients in NUV-u and u-i colours. We further distinguish them using an additional constraint provided by the u-i colour gradient distribution, under the assumption of constant galaxy formation rate and a common SFH followed by most galaxies. We find the best model is an inside-out growth model in which the inner region has a shorter e-folding time scale in the growth phase than the outer region. More spatially resolved ultraviolet (UV) observations are needed to improve the significance of the result.},

We apply spectral synthesis techniques to the datacubes and process the results to produce the mass growth time scales and mass weighted ages, from which we obtain temporal and spatially resolved information in seven bins of galaxy morphology and six bins of stellar mass (M\$\_\{$\backslash$star\}\$) and stellar mass surface density (\$$\backslash$Sigma\_\{$\backslash$star\}\$). We use three different tracers of the spatially resolved star formation history (mass assembly curves, ratio of half mass to half light radii, and mass-weighted age gradients) to test if galaxies grow inside-out, and its dependence with galaxy stellar mass, \$$\backslash$Sigma\_\{$\backslash$star\}\$, and morphology. Our main results are as follows: (a) The innermost regions of galaxies assemble their mass at an earlier time than regions located in the outer parts; this happens at any given M\$\_\{$\backslash$star\}\$, \$$\backslash$Sigma\_\{$\backslash$star\}\$, or Hubble type, including the lowest mass systems. (b) Galaxies present a significant diversity in their characteristic formation epochs for lower-mass systems. This diversity shows a strong dependence of the mass assembly time scales on \$$\backslash$Sigma\_\{$\backslash$star\}\$ and Hubble type in the lower-mass range (10\$\^\{8.4\}\$ to 10\$\^\{10.4\}\$), but a very mild dependence in higher-mass bins. (c) All galaxies show negative \$$\backslash$langle\$log age\$$\backslash$rangle\_\{M\}\$ gradients in the inner 1 HLR. The profile flattens with increasing values of \$$\backslash$Sigma\_\{$\backslash$star\}\$. There is no significant dependence on M\$\_\{$\backslash$star\}\$ within a particular \$$\backslash$Sigma\_\{$\backslash$star\}\$ bin, except for the lowest bin, where the gradients becomes steeper.},

  abstract = {We present a statistical study of the redshift evolution of the cluster galaxy population over a wide redshift range from 0.1 to 1.1, using \$$\backslash$sim 1900\$ optically-selected CAMIRA clusters from \$$\backslash$sim 232\$\textasciitilde{}deg\$\^2\$ of the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) Wide S16A data. Our stacking technique with a statistical background subtraction reveals color-magnitude diagrams of red-sequence and blue cluster galaxies down to faint magnitudes of \$m\_z$\backslash$sim 24\$. We find that the linear relation of red-sequence galaxies in the color-magnitude diagram extends down to the faintest magnitudes we explore with a small intrinsic scatter \$$\backslash$sigma\_\{$\backslash$rm int\}(g-r)$<$0.1\$. The scatter does not evolve significantly with redshift. The stacked color-magnitude diagrams are used to define red and blue galaxies in clusters for studying their radial number density profiles without resorting to photometric redshifts of individual galaxies. We find that red galaxies are significantly more concentrated toward cluster centers and blue galaxies dominate the outskirt of clusters. We explore the fraction of red galaxies in clusters as a function of redshift, and find that the red fraction decreases with increasing distances from cluster centers. The red fraction exhibits a moderate decrease with increasing redshift. The radial number density profiles of cluster member galaxies are also used to infer the location of the steepest slope in the three dimensional galaxy density profiles. For a fixed threshold in richness, we find little redshift evolution in this location.},

  abstract = {Distances to individual stars in our own Galaxy are critical in order to 
piece together the nature of its velocity and spatial structure. Core
helium burning red clump (RC) stars have similar luminosities, are
abundant throughout the Galaxy, and thus constitute good standard
candles. We build a hierarchical probabilistic model to quantify the
quality of RC stars as standard candles using parallax measurements from
the first Gaia data release. A unique aspect of our methodology is to
fully account for (and marginalize over) parallax, photometry, and dust
corrections uncertainties, which leads to more robust results than
standard approaches. We determine the absolute magnitude and intrinsic
dispersion of the RC in 2MASS bands J, H, Ks, Gaia G band, and WISE
bands W1, W2, W3, and W4. We find that the absolute magnitude of the RC
is \$-1.61 $\backslash$pm\$ 0.01 (in Ks), \$+0.44 $\backslash$pm\$ 0.01 (in G) , \$-0.93 $\backslash$pm\$ 0.01

0.02 (in W2), \$-1.67 $\backslash$pm\$ 0.02 (in W3), \$1.76 $\backslash$pm\$ 0.01 mag (in W4). The
mean intrinsic dispersion is \$$\backslash$sim 0.17 $\backslash$pm\$ 0.03 mag across all bands
(yielding a typical distance precision of \$$\backslash$sim\$ 8\%). Thus RC stars are
reliable and precise standard candles. In addition, we have also
re-calibrated the zero point of the absolute magnitude of the RC in each
band, which provide a benchmark for future studies to estimate distances
to RC stars. Finally, the parallax error shrinkage in the hierarchical
model outlined in this work can be used to obtain more precise
parallaxes than Gaia for the most distant RC stars across the Galaxy.},

  doi = {10.1051/0004-6361/201321718},
  abstract = {Context. Whenever correlation functions are used for inference about 
cosmological parameters in the context of a Bayesian analysis, the
likelihood function of correlation functions needs to be known. Usually,
it is approximated as a multivariate Gaussian, though this is not
necessarily a good approximation. Aims: We show how to calculate
a better approximation for the probability distribution of correlation
functions of one-dimensional random fields, which we call
"quasi-Gaussian". Methods: Using the exact univariate probability
distribution function (PDF) as well as constraints on correlation
functions previously derived, we transform the correlation functions to
an unconstrained variable for which the Gaussian approximation is well
justified. From this Gaussian in the transformed space, we obtain the
quasi-Gaussian PDF. The two approximations for the probability
distributions are compared to the "true" distribution as obtained from
simulations. Additionally, we test how the new approximation performs
when used as likelihood in a toy-model Bayesian analysis. 
Results: The quasi-Gaussian PDF agrees very well with the PDF obtained
from simulations; in particular, it provides a significantly better
description than a straightforward copula approach. In a simple
toy-model likelihood analysis, it yields noticeably different results
than the Gaussian likelihood, indicating its possible impact on
cosmological parameter estimation.

We have generated (6000) 12 288 MultiDark PATCHY BOSS (DR11) DR12 light

the halo abundance matching modelling of the BOSS DR11\&DR12 galaxy
clustering data and on the data themselves. The production follows three
steps. First, we apply the PATCHY code to generate a dark matter field
and an object distribution including non-linear stochastic galaxy bias.
Secondly, we run the halo/stellar distribution reconstruction HADRON
code to assign masses to the various objects. This step uses the mass
distribution as a function of local density and non-local indicators
(i.e. tidal field tensor eigenvalues and relative halo exclusion
separation for massive objects) from the reference simulation applied to
the corresponding patchy dark matter and galaxy distribution. Finally,
we apply the SUGAR code to build the light cones. The resulting
MultiDarkPATCHY mock light cones reproduce the number density, selection
function, survey geometry, and in general within 1$\sigma$, for arbitrary
stellar mass bins, the power spectrum up to k = 0.3 h Mpc-1,
the two-point correlation functions down to a few Mpc scales, and the

  shorttitle = {On the Use of the {{Edgeworth}} Expansion in Cosmology {{I}}},
  abstract = {Non-linear gravitational collapse introduces non-Gaussian statistics into the matter fields of the late Universe. As the large-scale structure is the target of current and future observational campaigns, one would ideally like to have the full probability density function of these non-Gaussian fields. The only viable way we see to achieve this analytically, at least approximately and in the near future, is via the Edgeworth expansion. We hence rederive this expansion for Fourier modes of non-Gaussian fields and then continue by putting it into a wider statistical context than previously done. We show that in its original form, the Edgeworth expansion only works if the non-Gaussian signal is averaged away. This is counterproductive, since we target the parameter-dependent non-Gaussianities as a signal of interest. We hence alter the analysis at the decisive step and now provide a roadmap towards a controlled and unadulterated analysis of non-Gaussianities in structure formation (with the Edgeworth expansion). Our central result is that, although the Edgeworth expansion has pathological properties, these can be predicted and avoided in a careful manner. We also show that, despite the non-Gaussianity coupling all modes, the Edgeworth series may be applied to any desired subset of modes, since this is equivalent (to the level of the approximation) to marginalising over the exlcuded modes. In this first paper of a series, we restrict ourselves to the sampling properties of the Edgeworth expansion, i.e.\textasciitilde{}how faithfully it reproduces the distribution of non-Gaussian data. A follow-up paper will detail its Bayesian use, when parameters are to be inferred.},

  abstract = {We perform a detailed analysis of the covariance matrix of the spherically averaged galaxy power spectrum and present a new, practical method for estimating this within an arbitrary survey without the need for running mock galaxy simulations that cover the full survey volume. The method uses theoretical arguments to modify the covariance matrix measured from a set of small-volume cubic galaxy simulations, which are computationally cheap to produce compared to larger simulations and match the measured small-scale galaxy clustering more accurately than is possible using theoretical modelling. We include prescriptions to analytically account for the window function of the survey, which convolves the measured covariance matrix in a non-trivial way. We also present a new method to include the effects of supersample covariance and modes outside the small simulation volume which requires no additional simulations and still allows us to scale the covariance matrix. As validation, we compare the covariance matrix estimated using our new method to that from a brute force calculation using 500 simulations originally created for analysis of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Main Galaxy Sample (SDSS-MGS). We find excellent agreement on all scales of interest for large scale structure analysis, including those dominated by the effects of the survey window, and on scales where theoretical models of the clustering normally break-down, but the new method produces a covariance matrix with significantly better signal-to-noise. Although only formally correct in real-space, we also discuss how our method can be extended to incorporate the effects of Redshift Space Distortions.},

  abstract = {Standard approaches to Bayesian parameter inference in large-scale 
structure assume a Gaussian functional form (chi-squared form) for the
likelihood. This assumption, in detail, cannot be correct. Likelihood
free inferences such as approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) relax
these restrictions and make inference possible without making any
assumptions on the likelihood. Instead ABC relies on a forward
generative model of the data and a metric for measuring the distance
between the model and data. In this work, we demonstrate that ABC is
feasible for LSS parameter inference by using it to constrain parameters
of the halo occupation distribution (HOD) model for populating dark
matter haloes with galaxies. Using specific implementation of ABC
supplemented with population Monte Carlo importance sampling, a
generative forward model using HOD and a distance metric based on galaxy
number density, two-point correlation function and galaxy group
multiplicity function, we constrain the HOD parameters of mock
observation generated from selected `true' HOD parameters. The parameter
constraints we obtain from ABC are consistent with the `true' HOD
parameters, demonstrating that ABC can be reliably used for parameter
inference in LSS. Furthermore, we compare our ABC constraints to
constraints we obtain using a pseudo-likelihood function of Gaussian
form with MCMC and find consistent HOD parameter constraints.
Ultimately, our results suggest that ABC can and should be applied in
parameter inference for LSS analyses.},

  title = {Maximal Compression of the Redshift Space Galaxy Power Spectrum and Bispectrum},
  abstract = {We explore two methods of compressing the redshift space galaxy power spectrum and bispectrum with respect to a chosen set of cosmological parameters. Both methods involve reducing the dimension of the original data-vector ( e.g. 1000 elements ) to the number of cosmological parameters considered ( e.g. seven ) using the Karhunen-Lo$\backslash$`eve algorithm. In the first case, we run MCMC sampling on the compressed data-vector in order to recover the one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) posterior distributions. The second option, approximately 2000 times faster, works by orthogonalising the parameter space through diagonalisation of the Fisher information matrix before the compression, obtaining the posterior distributions without the need of MCMC sampling. Using these methods for future spectroscopic redshift surveys like DESI, EUCLID and PFS would drastically reduce the number of simulations needed to compute accurate covariance matrices with minimal loss of constraining power. We consider a redshift bin of a DESI-like experiment. Using the power spectrum combined with the bispectrum as a data-vector, both compression methods on average recover the 68\% credible regions to within 0.5\% and 3.2\% of those resulting from standard MCMC sampling respectively. These confidence intervals are also smaller than the ones obtained using only the power spectrum by (81\%, 80\%, 82\%) respectively for the bias parameter b\_1, the growth rate f and the scalar amplitude parameter A\_s.},

  abstract = {Using the stellar kinematic maps and ancillary imaging data from the Sydney AAO Multi Integral field (SAMI) Galaxy Survey, the intrinsic shape of kinematically-selected samples of galaxies is inferred. We implement an efficient and optimised algorithm to fit the intrinsic shape of galaxies using an established method to simultaneously invert the distributions of apparent ellipticities and kinematic misalignments. The algorithm output compares favourably with previous studies of the intrinsic shape of galaxies based on imaging alone and our re-analysis of the ATLAS3D data. Our results indicate that most galaxies are oblate axisymmetric. We show empirically that the intrinsic shape of galaxies varies as a function of their rotational support as measured by the "spin" parameter proxy Lambda\_Re. In particular, low spin systems have a higher occurrence of triaxiality, while high spin systems are more intrinsically flattened and axisymmetric. The intrinsic shape of galaxies is linked to their formation and merger histories. Galaxies with high spin values have intrinsic shapes consistent with dissipational minor mergers, while the intrinsic shape of low-spin systems is consistent with dissipationless multi-merger assembly histories. This range in assembly histories inferred from intrinsic shapes is broadly consistent with expectations from cosmological simulations.},

The survey design includes a pattern of tiling on the sky and the locations of the fiber positioners in the focal plane of the telescope, with the observation strategy determined by a fiber assignment algorithm that optimizes the allocation of fibers to targets. This strategy allows a given region to be covered on average five times for a five-year survey, but with coverage varying between zero and twelve, which imprints a spatially-dependent pattern on the galaxy clustering. We investigate the systematic effects of the fiber assignment coverage on the anisotropic galaxy clustering of ELGs and show that, in the absence of any corrections, it leads to discrepancies of order ten percent on large scales for the power spectrum multipoles. We introduce a method where objects in a random catalog are assigned a coverage, and the mean density is separately computed for each coverage factor. We show that this method reduces, but does not eliminate the effect. We next investigate the angular dependence of the contaminated signal, arguing that it is mostly localized to purely transverse modes. We demonstrate that the cleanest way to remove the contaminating signal is to perform an analysis of the anisotropic power spectrum \$P(k,$\backslash$mu)\$ and remove the lowest \$$\backslash$mu\$ bin, leaving \$$\backslash$mu$>$0\$ modes accurate at the few-percent level. Here, \$$\backslash$mu\$ is the cosine of the angle between the line-of-sight and the direction of \$$\backslash$vec\{k\}\$. We also investigate two alternative definitions of the random catalog and show they are comparable but less effective than the coverage randoms method.},

  abstract = {Since cosmology is no longer ``the data-starved science,'' the problem 
of how to analyze large data sets best has recently received
considerable attention, and Karhunen-Lo{\`e}ve eigenvalue methods
have been applied to both galaxy redshift surveys and cosmic microwave
background (CMB) maps. We present a comprehensive discussion of methods
for estimating cosmological parameters from large data sets, which
includes the previously published techniques as special cases. We show
that both the problem of estimating several parameters jointly and the
problem of not knowing the parameters a priori can be readily solved by
adding an extra singular value decomposition step.

It has recently been argued that the information content in a sky map
from a next-generation CMB satellite is sufficient to measure key
cosmological parameters (h, $\Omega$, $\Lambda$, etc.) to an accuracy of a
few percent or better--in principle. In practice, the data set is so
large that both a brute force likelihood analysis and a direct expansion
in signal-to-noise eigenmodes will be computationally unfeasible. We
argue that it is likely that a Karhunen-Lo{\`e}ve approach can
nonetheless measure the parameters with close to maximal accuracy, if
preceded by an appropriate form of quadratic ``precompression.''

We also discuss practical issues regarding parameter estimation from
present and future galaxy redshift surveys and illustrate this with a
generalized eigenmode analysis of the IRAS 1.2 Jy survey optimized for
measuring $\beta$ $\equiv$ $\Omega$0.6/b using redshift space
distortions.},

  abstract = {The combination of galaxy-galaxy lensing (GGL) with galaxy clustering is one of the most promising routes to determining the amplitude of matter clustering at low redshifts. We show that extending clustering+GGL analyses from the linear regime down to \$$\backslash$sim 0.5 $\backslash$, h\^\{-1\}\$ Mpc scales increases their constraining power considerably, even after marginalizing over a flexible model of non-linear galaxy bias. Using a grid of cosmological N-body simulations, we construct a Taylor-expansion emulator that predicts the galaxy autocorrelation \$$\backslash$xi\_\{$\backslash$text\{gg\}\}(r)\$ and galaxy-matter cross-correlation \$$\backslash$xi\_\{$\backslash$text\{gm\}\}(r)\$ as a function of \$$\backslash$sigma\_8\$, \$$\backslash$Omega\_m\$, and halo occupation distribution (HOD) parameters, which are allowed to vary with large scale environment to represent possible effects of galaxy assembly bias. We present forecasts for a fiducial case that corresponds to BOSS LOWZ galaxy clustering and SDSS-depth weak lensing (effective source density \$$\backslash$sim 0.3\$ arcmin\$\^\{-2\}\$). Using tangential shear and projected correlation function measurements over \$0.5 $\backslash$leq r\_p $\backslash$leq 30 $\backslash$, h\^\{-1\}\$ Mpc yields a 1.8\% constraint on the parameter combination \$$\backslash$sigma\_8$\backslash$Omega\_m\^\{0.58\}\$, a factor of two better than a constraint that excludes non-linear scales (\$r\_p $>$ 2 $\backslash$, h\^\{-1\}\$ Mpc, \$4 $\backslash$, h\^\{-1\}\$ Mpc for \$$\backslash$gamma\_t,w\_p\$). Much of this improvement comes from the non-linear clustering information, which breaks degeneracies among HOD parameters that would otherwise degrade the inference of matter clustering from GGL. Increasing the effective source density to \$3\$ arcmin\$\^\{-2\}\$ sharpens the constraint on \$$\backslash$sigma\_8$\backslash$Omega\_m\^\{0.58\}\$ by a further factor of two. With robust modeling into the non-linear regime, low-redshift measurements of matter clustering at the 1-percent level with clustering+GGL alone are well within reach of current data sets such as those provided by the Dark Energy Survey.},

  abstract = {Efficient estimators of Fourier-space statistics for large number of objects rely on fast Fourier transforms (FFTs), which are affected by aliasing from unresolved small-scale modes due to the finite FFT grid. Aliasing takes the form of a sum over images, each of them corresponding to the Fourier content displaced by increasing multiples of the sampling frequency of the grid. These spurious contributions limit the accuracy in the estimation of Fourier-space statistics, and are typically ameliorated by simultaneously increasing grid size and discarding high-frequency modes. This results in inefficient estimates for e.g. the power spectrum when desired systematic biases are well under per cent level. We show that using interlaced grids removes odd images, which include the dominant contribution to aliasing. In addition, we discuss the choice of interpolation kernel used to define density perturbations on the FFT grid and demonstrate that using higher order interpolation kernels than the standard Cloud-In-Cell algorithm results in significant reduction of the remaining images. We show that combining fourth-order interpolation with interlacing gives very accurate Fourier amplitudes and phases of density perturbations. This results in power spectrum and bispectrum estimates that have systematic biases below 0.01 per cent all the way to the Nyquist frequency of the grid, thus maximizing the use of unbiased Fourier coefficients for a given grid size and greatly reducing systematics for applications to large cosmological data sets.},

  abstract = {We explore observational and theoretical constraints on how galaxies might transition between the "star-forming main sequence" (SFMS) and varying "degrees of quiescence" out to \$z=3\$. Our analysis is focused on galaxies with stellar mass \$M\_*$>$10\^\{10\}M\_\{$\backslash$odot\}\$, and is enabled by GAMA and CANDELS observations, a semi-analytic model (SAM) of galaxy formation, and a cosmological hydrodynamical "zoom in" simulation with momentum-driven AGN feedback. In both the observations and the SAM, transition galaxies tend to have intermediate S$\backslash$'ersic indices, half-light radii, and surface stellar mass densities compared to star-forming and quiescent galaxies out to \$z=3\$. We place an observational upper limit on the average population transition timescale as a function of redshift, finding that the average high-redshift galaxy is on a "fast track" for quenching whereas the average low-redshift galaxy is on a "slow track" for quenching. We qualitatively identify four physical origin scenarios for transition galaxies in the SAM: oscillations on the SFMS, slow quenching, fast quenching, and rejuvenation. Quenching timescales in both the SAM and the hydrodynamical simulation are not fast enough to reproduce the quiescent population that we observe at \$z$\backslash$sim3\$. In the SAM, we do not find a clear-cut morphological dependence of quenching timescales, but we do predict that the mean stellar ages, cold gas fractions, SMBH masses, and halo masses of transition galaxies tend to be intermediate relative to those of star-forming and quiescent galaxies at \$z$<$3\$.},

  title = {Comparing Galaxy Formation in Semi-Analytic Models and Hydrodynamical Simulations},
  abstract = {It is now possible for hydrodynamical simulations to reproduce a representative galaxy population. Accordingly, it is timely to assess critically some of the assumptions of traditional semi-analytic galaxy formation models. We use the Eagle simulations to assess assumptions built into the Galform semi-analytic model, focussing on those relating to baryon cycling, angular momentum and feedback. We show that the assumption in Galform that newly formed stars have the same specific angular momentum as the total disc leads to a significant overestimate of the total stellar specific angular momentum of disc galaxies. In Eagle, stars form preferentially out of low specific angular momentum gas in the interstellar medium (ISM) due to the assumed gas density threshold for stars to form, leading to more realistic galaxy sizes. We find that stellar mass assembly is similar between Galform and Eagle but that the evolution of gas properties is different, with various indications that the rate of baryon cycling in Eagle is slower than is assumed in Galform. Finally, by matching individual galaxies between Eagle and Galform, we find that an artificial dependence of AGN feedback and gas infall rates on halo mass doubling events in Galform drives most of the scatter in stellar mass between individual objects. Put together our results suggest that the Galform semi-analytic model can be significantly improved in light of recent advances.},

We construct estimators for radial distortions that, using only Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs) of the overdensity field multipoles for a given survey geometry, compute the power spectrum monopole, quadrupole and hexadecapole, and generalize such estimators to the bispectrum. Using realistic mock catalogs we compare the signal to noise of two estimators for the power spectrum hexadecapole that require different number of FFTs and measure the bispectrum monopole, quadrupole and hexadecapole. The resulting algorithm is very efficient, e.g. for the BOSS survey requires about three minutes for \$$\backslash$ell=0,2,4\$ power spectra for scales up to \$k=0.3\textasciitilde{}h/\$Mpc and about fifteen additional minutes for \$$\backslash$ell=0,2,4\$ bispectra for all scales and triangle shapes up to \$k=0.2\textasciitilde{}h/\$Mpc on a single core. The speed of these estimators is essential as it makes possible to compute covariance matrices from large number of realizations of mock catalogs with realistic survey characteristics, and paves the way for improved constrains of gravity on cosmological scales, inflation and galaxy bias.},

Although the evolution of the bispectrum is well understood theoretically from non-linear perturbation theory and numerical simulations, applications to galaxy surveys require a number of issues to be addressed. In this paper we consider the effect on the bispectrum of stochastic non-linear biasing, radial redshift distortions, non-Gaussian initial conditions, survey geometry and sampling. We find that: 1) bias stochasticity does not affect the use of the bispectrum to recover the mean biasing relation between galaxies and mass, at least for models in which the scatter is uncorrelated at large scales. 2) radial redshift distortions do not change significantly the monopole power spectrum and bispectrum compared to their plane-parallel values. 3) survey geometry leads to finite volume effects which must be taken into account in current surveys before comparison with theoretical predictions can be made. 4) sparse sampling and survey geometry correlate different triangles leading to a breakdown of the Gaussian likelihood approximation. We develop a likelihood analysis using bispectrum eigenmodes, calculated by Monte Carlo realizations of mock surveys generated with second-order Lagrangian perturbation theory and checked against N-body simulations. In a companion paper we apply these results to the analysis of the bispectrum of IRAS galaxies.},

Our model combines the evolution of the locus on the BPT diagram measured in spectroscopic data out to z \textasciitilde{} 2.5 with the strong dependence of [NII]/H\$$\backslash$alpha\$ on stellar mass and [OIII]/H\$$\backslash$beta\$ observed in local galaxy samples. We find large variations in the [NII]/H\$$\backslash$alpha\$ flux ratio at a fixed redshift due to its dependency on stellar mass, hence the assumption of a constant [NII] contamination fraction can lead to a significant under- or over-estimate of H\$$\backslash$alpha\$ luminosities. Specifically, measurements of the intrinsic H\$$\backslash$alpha\$ luminosity function derived from current low-resolution grism spectroscopy assuming a constant 29\% contamination of [NII] are likely over-estimated by factors of 2-4 at log(L) $>$ 43.0 and systematically under-estimated by \textasciitilde{}50 at log(L) $<$ 42.5 at redshifts z \textasciitilde{} 1.5.

  title = {Scale-Dependent Bias and Bispectrum in Neutrino Separate Universe Simulations},
  abstract = {Cosmic background neutrinos have a large velocity dispersion, which causes the evolution of long-wavelength density perturbations to depend on scale. This scale-dependent growth leads to the well-known suppression in the linear theory matter power spectrum that is used to probe neutrino mass. In this paper, we study the impact of long-wavelength density perturbations on small-scale structure formation. By performing separate universe simulations where the long-wavelength mode is absorbed into the local expansion, we measure the responses of the cold dark matter (CDM) power spectrum and halo mass function, which correspond to the squeezed-limit bispectrum and halo bias. We find that the scale-dependent evolution of the long-wavelength modes causes these quantities to depend on scale and provide simple expressions to model them in terms of scale and the amount of massive neutrinos. Importantly, this scale-dependent bias reduces the suppression in the linear halo power spectrum due to massive neutrinos by 13 and 26\% for objects of bias \$$\backslash$bar\{b\}=2\$ and \$$\backslash$bar\{b\} $\backslash$gg1\$, respectively. We demonstrate with high statistical significance that the scale-dependent halo bias \$\{$\backslash$it cannot\}\$ be modeled by the CDM and neutrino density transfer functions at the time when the halos are identified. This reinforces the importance of the temporal nonlocality of structure formation, especially when the growth is scale dependent.},

Thus, the mechanism(s) responsible for quenching central galaxies plays a crucial role in galaxy evolution as whole. We combine a high resolution cosmological \$N\$-body simulation with observed evolutionary trends of the "star formation main sequence," quiescent fraction, and stellar mass function at \$z $<$ 1\$ to construct a model that statistically tracks the star formation histories and quenching of central galaxies. Comparing this model to the distribution of central galaxy star formation rates in a group catalog of the SDSS Data Release 7, we constrain the timescales over which physical processes cease star formation in central galaxies. Over the stellar mass range \$10\^\{9.5\}\$ to \$10\^\{11\} $\backslash$mathrm\{M\}\_$\backslash$odot\$ we infer quenching e-folding times that span \$1.5\$ to \$0.5$\backslash$; $\backslash$mathrm\{Gyr\}\$ with more massive central galaxies quenching faster. For \$$\backslash$mathcal\{M\}\_* = 10\^\{10.5\}$\backslash$mathrm\{M\}\_$\backslash$odot\$, this implies a total migration time of \$$\backslash$sim 4\textasciitilde$\backslash$mathrm\{Gyrs\}\$ from the star formation main sequence to quiescence. Compared to satellites, central galaxies take \$$\backslash$sim 2\textasciitilde$\backslash$mathrm\{Gyrs\}\$ longer to quench their star formation, suggesting that different mechanisms are responsible for quenching centrals versus satellites. Finally, the central galaxy quenching timescale we infer provides key constraints for proposed star formation quenching mechanisms. Our timescale is generally consistent with gas depletion timescales predicted by quenching through strangulation. However, the exact physical mechanism(s) responsible for this still remain unclear.},

  shorttitle = {Analysis of the {{SFR}} - {{M}}* Plane at Z$<$3},
  abstract = {The analysis of galaxies on the SFR-M* plane is a powerful diagnostic for galaxy evolution at different cosmic times. We considered a sample of 24463 galaxies from the CANDELS/GOODS-S survey to conduct a detailed analysis of the SFR-M* relation at redshifts 0.5\$$\backslash$leqslant z$<$\$3 over more than three dex in stellar mass. To obtain SFR estimates, we utilized mid- and far-IR photometry when available, and rest-UV fluxes for all the other galaxies. We performed our analysis in different redshift bins, with two different methods: 1) a linear regression fitting of all star-forming galaxies, defined as those with specific star formation rates \$$\backslash$rm log\_\{10\}(sSFR/yr\^\{-1\}) $>$ -9.8\$, similarly to what is typically done in the literature; 2) a multi-Gaussian decomposition to identify the galaxy main sequence (MS), the starburst sequence and the quenched galaxy cloud. We found that the MS slope becomes flatter when higher stellar mass cuts are adopted, and that the apparent slope change observed at high masses depends on the SFR estimation method. In addition, the multi-Gaussian decomposition reveals the presence of a starburst population which increases towards low stellar masses and high redshifts. We found that starbursts make \textasciitilde{}5\% of all galaxies at z=0.5-1.0, while they account for \textasciitilde{}14\% of galaxies at 1$<$z$<$3 with log\$\_\{10\}(M\^\{*\})=\$8.25-11.25. We conclude that the dissection of the SFR-M* in multiple components over a wide range of stellar masses is necessary to understand the importance of the different modes of star formation through cosmic time.},

  abstract = {We explore the phenomenon commonly known as halo assembly bias, whereby dark matter halos of the same mass are found to be more or less clustered when a second halo property is considered, for halos in the mass range \$3.7 $\backslash$times 10\^\{11\} $\backslash$; h\^\{-1\} $\backslash$mathrm\{M\_\{$\backslash$odot\}\} - 5.0 $\backslash$times 10\^\{13\} $\backslash$; h\^\{-1\} $\backslash$mathrm\{M\_\{$\backslash$odot\}\}\$. Using the Large Suite of Dark Matter Simulations (LasDamas) we consider nine commonly used halo properties and find that a clustering bias exists if halos are binned by mass or by any other halo property. This secondary bias implies that no single halo property encompasses all the spatial clustering information of the halo population. The mean values of some halo properties depend on their halo's distance to a more massive neighbor. Halo samples selected by having high values of one of these properties therefore inherit a neighbor bias such that they are much more likely to be close to a much more massive neighbor. This neighbor bias largely accounts for the secondary bias seen in halos binned by mass and split by concentration or age. However, halos binned by other mass-like properties still show a secondary bias even when the neighbor bias is removed. The secondary bias of halos selected by their spin behaves differently than that for other halo properties, suggesting that the origin of the spin bias is different than of other secondary biases.},

  shorttitle = {Accurate {{Modelling}} of {{Galaxy Clustering}} on {{Small Scales}}},
  abstract = {Interpreting the small-scale clustering of galaxies with halo models can elucidate the connection between galaxies and dark matter halos. Unfortunately, the modelling is typically not sufficiently accurate for ruling out models in a statistical sense. It is thus difficult to use the information encoded in small scales to test cosmological models or probe subtle features of the galaxy-halo connection. In this paper, we attempt to push halo modelling into the "accurate" regime with a fully numerical mock-based methodology and careful treatment of statistical and systematic errors. An advantage of this approach is that it can easily incorporate clustering statistics beyond the traditional two-point statistics. We use this modelling methodology to test the standard \$$\backslash$Lambda$\backslash$mathrm\{CDM\}\$ + halo model against the clustering of SDSS DR7 galaxies. Specifically, we use the projected correlation function, group multiplicity function and galaxy number density as constraints. We find that while the model provides a good match to each statistic separately, it struggles to fit them jointly. Adding group statistics leads to a more stringent test of the model and significantly tighter constraints on model parameters. We explore the impact of varying the adopted halo definition and cosmological model and find that changing the cosmology makes a significant difference. The most successful model we tried (Planck cosmology with Mvir halos) matches the clustering of low luminosity galaxies, but exhibits a \$2.3 $\backslash$sigma\$ tension with the clustering of luminous galaxies, thus providing evidence that the "standard" halo model needs to be extended. This work represents the most accurate modelling of small-scale clustering to-date and opens the door to adding interesting freedom to the halo model and including additional clustering statistics as constraints.},

  shorttitle = {Galaxy {{Cluster Mass Reconstruction Project}}},
  abstract = {With the advent of wide-field cosmological surveys, we are approaching samples of hundreds of thousands of galaxy clusters. While such large numbers will help reduce statistical uncertainties, the control of systematics in cluster masses becomes ever more crucial. Here we examine the effects of an important source of systematic uncertainty in galaxy-based cluster mass estimation techniques: the presence of significant dynamical substructure. Dynamical substructure manifests as dynamically distinct subgroups in phase-space, indicating an 'unrelaxed' state. This issue affects around a quarter of clusters in a generally selected sample. We employ a set of mock clusters whose masses have been measured homogeneously with commonly-used galaxy-based mass estimation techniques (kinematic, richness, caustic, radial methods). We use these to study how the relation between observationally estimated and true cluster mass depends on the presence of substructure, as identified by various popular diagnostics. We find that the scatter for an ensemble of clusters does not increase dramatically for clusters with dynamical substructure. However, we find a systematic bias for all methods, such that clusters with significant substructure have higher measured masses than their relaxed counterparts. This bias depends on cluster mass: the most massive clusters are largely unaffected by the presence of significant substructure, but masses are significantly overestimated for lower mass clusters, by \$$\backslash$sim10$\backslash$\%\$ at \$10\^\{14\}\$ and \$$\backslash$geq20$\backslash$\%\$ for \$$\backslash$leq10\^\{13.5\}\$. The use of cluster samples with different levels of substructure can, therefore, bias certain cosmological parameters up to a level comparable to the typical uncertainties in current cosmological studies.},

We obtain dust-corrected SFRs by fitting the GALEX (UV) and SDSS (optical) photometry to a library of population synthesis models that include dust attenuation. For star-forming galaxies, our UV-based SFRs compare remarkably well with those derived from SDSS H alpha. Deviations from perfect agreement between these two methods are due to differences in the dust attenuation estimates. In contrast to H alpha, UV provides reliable SFRs for galaxies with weak or no H alpha emission, and where H alpha is contaminated with an emission from an AGN. We use full-SED SFRs to calibrate a simple prescription that uses GALEX UV magnitudes to produce good SFRs for normal star-forming galaxies. The specific SFR is considered as a function of stellar mass for (1) star-forming galaxies with no AGN, (2) those hosting an AGN, and for (3) galaxies without H alpha emission. We find that the three have distinct star formation histories, with AGN lying intermediate between the star-forming and the quiescent galaxies. Normal star forming galaxies (without an AGN) lie on a relatively narrow linear sequence. Remarkably, galaxies hosting a strong AGN appear to represent the massive continuation of this sequence. Weak AGN, while also massive, have lower SFR, sometimes extending to the realm of quiescent galaxies. We propose an evolutionary sequence for massive galaxies that smoothly connects normal star-forming galaxies to quiescent (red sequence) galaxies via strong and weak AGN. We confirm that some galaxies with no H alpha emission show signs of SF in the UV. We derive a UV-based cosmic SFR density at z=0.1 with smaller total error than previous measurements (abridged).},

star formation rates (SFRs) and lie on the `red sequence' than central
(`field') galaxies. Using galaxy group/cluster catalogues from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7, together with a high-resolution,
cosmological N-body simulation to track satellite orbits, we examine the
star formation histories and quenching time-scales of satellites of
Mstar $>$ 5 \texttimes{} 109 M$\odot$ at z
$\approx$ 0. We first explore satellite infall histories: group preprocessing
and ejected orbits are critical aspects of satellite evolution, and
properly accounting for these, satellite infall typically occurred at z
\texttildelow{} 0.5, or \texttildelow{}5 Gyr ago. To obtain accurate initial conditions
for the SFRs of satellites at their time of first infall, we construct
an empirical parametrization for the evolution of central galaxy SFRs
and quiescent fractions. With this, we constrain the importance and
efficiency of satellite quenching as a function of satellite and host
halo mass, finding that satellite quenching is the dominant process for
building up all quiescent galaxies at Mstar $<$
1010 M$\odot$. We then constrain satellite star
formation histories, finding a `delayed-then-rapid' quenching scenario:
satellite SFRs evolve unaffected for 2-4 Gyr after infall, after which
star formation quenches rapidly, with an e-folding time of $<$0.8 Gyr.
These quenching time-scales are shorter for more massive satellites but
do not depend on host halo mass: the observed increase in the satellite
quiescent fraction with halo mass arises simply because of satellites
quenching in a lower mass group prior to infall (group preprocessing),
which is responsible for up to half of quenched satellites in massive
clusters. Because of the long time delay before quenching starts,
satellites experience significant stellar mass growth after infall,
nearly identical to central galaxies. This fact provides key physical
insight into the subhalo abundance matching method.},

logM*. The range of log(SFR) remains constant to z$>$1,
while the MS as a whole moves to higher SFR as z increases. The range of
the SFR along the MS constrains the amplitude of episodic variations of
SF and the effect of mergers on the SFR. Typical galaxies spend

their average SFR at a given M* and z. The dominant mode of

average SFR in most individual galaxies, not a decreasing frequency of

starbursts. LIRGs at z\textasciitilde{}1 seem to mostly reflect the high SFR typical for
massive galaxies at that epoch. The smooth MS may reflect that the same

characteristic stellar mass m* = 6.7 \texttimes
1010Msolar and with faint-end slope $\alpha$ =

The projected autocorrelation function of stellar mass is robustly and precisely determined for rp $<$ 30h-1Mpc. Over the range 10h-1kpc $<$
rp $<$ 10h-1Mpc, it is extremely well represented by a power law. The corresponding three-dimensional autocorrelation function is $\xi$*(r) = (r/6.1h-1Mpc)-1.84.
Relative to the dark matter, the bias of the stellar mass distribution is approximately constant on large scales, but varies by a factor of 5 for rp $<$ 1h-1Mpc. This behaviour is
approximately but not perfectly reproduced by current models for galaxy formation in the concordance $\Lambda$cold dark matter cosmology.
Detailed comparison suggests that a fluctuation amplitude

We show that the effect of neutrinos on the clustering of halos is very different, on all scales, to the one induced by \$$\backslash$sigma\_8\$. We find that the effects of neutrinos of the growth rate of CDM+baryons ranges from \$$\backslash$sim0.3$\backslash$\%\$ to \$2$\backslash$\%\$ on scales \$k$\backslash$in[0.01, 0.5]\textasciitilde{}h\{$\backslash$rm Mpc\}\^\{-1\}\$ for neutrinos with masses \$M\_$\backslash$nu $\backslash$leqslant 0.15\$ eV. We compute the bias between the momentum of halos and the momentum of CDM+baryon and find it to be 1 on large scales for all models with massless and massive neutrinos considered. This point towards a velocity bias between halos and total matter on large scales that it is important to account for in order to extract unbiased neutrino information from velocity/momentum surveys such as kSZ observations. We show that baryonic effects can affect the clustering of matter and CDM+baryons in redshift-space by up to a few percent down to \$k=0.5\textasciitilde{}h\{$\backslash$rm Mpc\}\^\{-1\}\$. We find that hydrodynamics and astrophysical processes, as implemented in our simulations, only distort the relative effect that neutrinos induce on the anisotropic clustering of matter, CDM+baryons and halos in redshift-space by less than \$1$\backslash$\%\$. Thus, the effect of neutrinos in the fully non-linear regime can be written as a transfer function with very weak dependence on astrophysics.},

Currently, N-body simulations comprise the only viable approach to this problem. In this paper we demonstrate that N-body simulations can indeed be sufficiently controlled to fulfill these requirements for the needs of ongoing and near-future weak lensing surveys. By performing a large suite of cosmological simulation comparison and convergence tests we show that results for the nonlinear matter power spectrum can be obtained at 1\% accuracy out to k\textasciitilde{}1 h/Mpc. The key components of these high accuracy simulations are: precise initial conditions, very large simulation volumes, sufficient mass resolution, and accurate time stepping. This paper is the first in a series of three, with the final aim to provide a high-accuracy prediction scheme for the nonlinear matter power spectrum.},

  abstract = {The power spectrum of density fluctuations is a foundational source of cosmological information. Precision cosmological probes targeted primarily at investigations of dark energy require accurate theoretical determinations of the power spectrum in the nonlinear regime. To exploit the observational power of future cosmological surveys, accuracy demands on the theory are at the one percent level or better. Numerical simulations are currently the only way to produce sufficiently error-controlled predictions for the power spectrum. The very high computational cost of (precision) N-body simulations is a major obstacle to obtaining predictions in the nonlinear regime, while scanning over cosmological parameters. Near-future observations, however, are likely to provide a meaningful constraint only on constant dark energy equation of state 'wCDM' cosmologies. In this paper we demonstrate that a limited set of only 37 cosmological models -- the "Coyote Universe" suite -- can be used to predict the nonlinear matter power spectrum at the required accuracy over a prior parameter range set by cosmic microwave background observations. This paper is the second in a series of three, with the final aim to provide a high-accuracy prediction scheme for the nonlinear matter power spectrum for wCDM cosmologies.},

  abstract = {Many of the most exciting questions in astrophysics and cosmology, including the majority of observational probes of dark energy, rely on an understanding of the nonlinear regime of structure formation. In order to fully exploit the information available from this regime and to extract cosmological constraints, accurate theoretical predictions are needed. Currently such predictions can only be obtained from costly, precision numerical simulations. This paper is the third in a series aimed at constructing an accurate calibration of the nonlinear mass power spectrum on Mpc scales for a wide range of currently viable cosmological models, including dark energy. The first two papers addressed the numerical challenges, and the scheme by which an interpolator was built from a carefully chosen set of cosmological models. In this paper we introduce the "Coyote Univers"' simulation suite which comprises nearly 1,000 N-body simulations at different force and mass resolutions, spanning 38 wCDM cosmologies. This large simulation suite enables us to construct a prediction scheme, or emulator, for the nonlinear matter power spectrum accurate at the percent level out to k\textasciitilde{}1 h/Mpc. We describe the construction of the emulator, explain the tests performed to ensure its accuracy, and discuss how the central ideas may be extended to a wider range of cosmological models and applications.

  abstract = {Modern sky surveys are returning precision measurements of cosmological statistics such as weak lensing shear correlations, the distribution of galaxies, and cluster abundance. To fully exploit these observations, theorists must provide predictions that are at least as accurate as the measurements, as well as robust estimates of systematic errors that are inherent to the modeling process. In the nonlinear regime of structure formation, this challenge can only be overcome by developing a large-scale, multi-physics simulation capability covering a range of cosmological models and astrophysical processes. As a first step to achieving this goal, we have recently developed a prediction scheme for the matter power spectrum (a so-called emulator), accurate at the 1\% level out to k\textasciitilde{}1/Mpc and z=1 for wCDM cosmologies based on a set of high-accuracy N-body simulations. It is highly desirable to increase the range in both redshift and wavenumber and to extend the reach in cosmological parameter space. To make progress in this direction, while minimizing computational cost, we present a strategy that maximally re-uses the original simulations. We demonstrate improvement over the original spatial dynamic range by an order of magnitude, reaching k\textasciitilde{}10 h/Mpc, a four-fold increase in redshift coverage, to z=4, and now include the Hubble parameter as a new independent variable. To further the range in k and z, a new set of nested simulations run at modest cost is added to the original set. The extension in h is performed by including perturbation theory results within a multi-scale procedure for building the emulator. This economical methodology still gives excellent error control, \textasciitilde{}5\% near the edges of the domain of applicability of the emulator. A public domain code for the new emulator is released as part of the work presented in this paper.},

These include long-standing concerns such as the estimation of coherent shears from galaxy images or redshift distributions of galaxies selected based on photometric redshifts, along with systematic uncertainties that have received less attention to date because they are subdominant contributors to the error budget in current surveys. I also discuss methods for automated systematics detection using survey data of the 2020s.

Even though the assumption of a Gaussian likelihood is motivated by the central limit theorem, we discuss that it leads to Fisher information content that violates the Cram$\backslash$'er-Rao bound if used consistently, owing to independent but artificial information from the parameter-dependent covariance matrix. At any fixed multipole, this artificial term is shown to become dominant in the case of a large number of correlated fields. While the distribution of the estimators does indeed tend to a Gaussian with a large number of modes, it is shown, however, that its Fisher information content does not, in the sense that their covariance matrix never carries independent information content, precisely because of the non-Gaussian shape of the distribution. In this light, we discuss the use of parameter-dependent covariance matrices with Gaussian likelihoods for parameter inference from two-point statistics. As a rule of thumb, Gaussian likelihoods should always be used with a covariance matrix fixed in parameter space, since only this guarantees that conservative information content is assigned to the observables, and at the same time prevents biases appearing.},

  title = {A {{Bayesian Hierarchical Approach}} to {{Galaxy}}-{{Galaxy Lensing}}},
  abstract = {We present a Bayesian hierarchical inference formalism to study the relation between the properties of dark matter halos and those of their central galaxies using weak gravitational lensing. Unlike traditional methods, this technique does not resort to stacking the weak lensing signal in bins, and thus allows for a more efficient use of the information content in the data. Our method is particularly useful for constraining scaling relations between two or more galaxy properties and dark matter halo mass, and can also be used to constrain the intrinsic scatter in these scaling relations. We show that, if observational scatter is not properly accounted for, the traditional stacking method can produce biased results when exploring correlations between multiple galaxy properties and halo mass. For example, this bias can affect studies of the joint correlation between galaxy mass, halo mass, and galaxy size, or galaxy color. In contrast, our method easily and efficiently handles the intrinsic and observational scatter in multiple galaxy properties and halo mass. We test our method on mocks with varying degrees of complexity. We find that we can recover the mean halo mass and concentration, each with a \$0.1\$ dex accuracy, and the intrinsic scatter in halo mass with a \$0.05\$ dex accuracy. In its current version, our method will be most useful for studying the weak lensing signal around central galaxies in groups and clusters, as well as massive galaxies samples with \$$\backslash$log\{M\_*\} $>$ 11\$, which have low satellite fractions.},

  abstract = {We study radial profiles in H\$$\backslash$alpha\$ equivalent width and specific star formation rate (sSFR) derived from spatially-resolved SDSS-IV MaNGA spectroscopy to gain insight on the physical mechanisms that suppress star formation and determine a galaxy's location in the SFR-\$$\backslash$rm M\_$\backslash$star\$ diagram. Even within the star-forming blue cloud, the typical sSFR profile depends on stellar mass. Flat radial profiles are observed for \$$\backslash$rm log(M\_$\backslash$star/M\_$\backslash$odot ) $<$ 10.5\$, while star-forming galaxies of higher mass show a significant decrease in sSFR in the central regions, a likely consequence of both larger bulges and an inside-out growth history. Our primary focus is the green valley where, at all masses, we find sSFR profiles that are suppressed with respect to normal star-forming galaxies at all galactocentric distances out to 2 effective radii. The responsible quenching mechanism therefore appears to affect the entire galaxy, not simply an expanding central region. However, those galaxies in which central star formation has shut down (classified spectroscopically as central low-ionisation emission-line regions, or cLIERs) show an even stronger suppression in sSFR across the whole disc. These systems are also more suppressed than green valley galaxies with residual, central star-formation. In fact, compared to structural parameters like \$$\backslash$Sigma\_1\$ (the mass surface density within 1 kpc), central quiescence is a stronger predictor of ongoing sSFR suppression at fixed \$$\backslash$rm M\_$\backslash$star\$. The green valley hosts both quiescent bulges and strongly suppressed star forming discs, supporting a scenario in which a slow quenching process affects the entire galaxy, and not just the central regions.},

  abstract = {We study the spatially-resolved star formation rates of 1494 galaxies in the SDSSIV-MaNGA Survey. Star formation rates are calculated using a two-step process, exploiting H\$\_$\backslash$alpha\$ in star-forming regions and \$D\_n4000\$ in zones identified as AGN/LI(N)ER or lineless according to the BPT diagram. This enables a complete view of how radial profiles of specific star formation rate depend on stellar mass, galaxy structure and environment, providing valuable clues about the nature of both secular and environmental quenching processes. We report on the existence of `Centrally Suppressed' galaxies, which have lower SSFR in their cores compared to their disks. The profiles of centrally suppressed and unsuppressed galaxies are distributed in a bimodal way, with very few galaxies having intermediate profile shapes. Galaxies with large stellar masses and central velocity dispersions are much more likely to be centrally-suppressed than low-mass galaxies, a result linked to their morphology and the presence of AGN/LI(N)ER like emission. Centrally suppressed galaxies also display lower star formation at all radii compared to unsuppressed galaxies. Independent of galaxy type, galaxies identified as satellites in larger dark matter halos have noticeably lower SSFR at outer radii compared to central galaxies. This uniform suppression could be a signal of the stripping of hot gas reservoirs through a process like strangulation. We find that satellites are not more likely to be suppressed in their cores than centrals, indicating that core suppression is an entirely secular process. We find no secondary correlation between the local environment density and the profiles of star formation rate surface density.},

In this work, we demonstrate that ABC is feasible for LSS parameter inference by using it to constrain parameters of the halo occupation distribution (HOD) model for populating dark matter halos with galaxies. Using specific implementation of ABC supplemented with Population Monte Carlo importance sampling, a generative forward model using HOD, and a distance metric based on galaxy number density, two-point correlation function, and galaxy group multiplicity function, we constrain the HOD parameters of mock observation generated from selected "true" HOD parameters. The parameter constraints we obtain from ABC are consistent with the "true" HOD parameters, demonstrating that ABC can be reliably used for parameter inference in LSS. Furthermore, we compare our ABC constraints to constraints we obtain using a pseudo-likelihood function of Gaussian form with MCMC and find consistent HOD parameter constraints. Ultimately our results suggest that ABC can and should be applied in parameter inference for LSS analyses.},

We discuss all the ingredients necessary to model the non-linear matter and cold dark matter power spectra and compare with the results of N-body simulations that incorporate massive neutrinos. Our neutrino halo model is able to capture the non-linear behavior of matter clustering with a \$$\backslash$sim 20$\backslash$\%\$ accuracy up to very non-linear scales of \$k=10\textasciitilde{}h/\$Mpc (which would be affected by baryon physics). The largest discrepancies arise in the range \$k=0.5-1\textasciitilde{}h/\$Mpc where the 1-halo and 2-halo terms are comparable and are present also in a massless neutrino cosmology. However, at scales \$k$<$0.2\textasciitilde{}h/\$Mpc our neutrino halo model agrees with the results of N-body simulations at the level of 8$\backslash$\% for total neutrino masses of \$$<$0.3\$ eV. We also model the neutrino non-linear density field as a sum of a linear and clustered component and predict the neutrino power spectrum and the cold dark matter-neutrino cross-power spectrum up to \$k=1\textasciitilde{}h/\$Mpc with \$$\backslash$sim\$ 30$\backslash$\% accuracy. For masses below 0.15 eV the neutrino halo model captures the neutrino induced suppression, casted in terms of matter power ratios between massive and massless scenarios, with a 2$\backslash$\% agreement with the results of N-body/neutrino simulations. Finally, we provide a simple application of the halo model: the computation of the clustering of galaxies, in massless and massive neutrinos cosmologies, using a simple Halo Occupation Distribution scheme and our halo model extension.},

  abstract = {Adopting the framework of the Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD), we investigate the ability of galaxy clustering measurements to simultaneously constrain cosmological parameters and galaxy bias. Starting with a fiducial cosmological model and galaxy HOD, we calculate spatial clustering observables on a range of length and mass scales, dynamical clustering observables that depend on galaxy peculiar velocities, and the galaxy-matter cross-correlation measurable by weak lensing. We then change one or more cosmological parameters and use chi\^2-minimization to find the galaxy HOD that best reproduces the original clustering. Our parameterization of the HOD incorporates a flexible relation between galaxy occupation numbers and halo mass and allows spatial and velocity bias of galaxies within dark matter halos. Despite this flexibility, we find that changes to the HOD cannot mask substantial changes to the matter density Omega\_m, the matter clustering amplitude sigma\_8, or the shape parameter Gamma of the linear matter power spectrum -- cosmology and bias are not degenerate. With the conservative assumption of 10\% fractional errors, the set of observables considered here can provide \textasciitilde{}10\% (1 sigma) constraints on sigma\_8, Omega\_m, and Gamma, using galaxy clustering data ALONE. The combination sigma\_8*Omega\_m\^0.75 is constrained to \textasciitilde{}5\%. In combination with traditional methods that focus on large scale structure in the "perturbative" regime, HOD modeling can greatly amplify the cosmological power of galaxy redshift surveys by taking advantage of high-precision clustering measurements at small and intermediate scales (from sub-Mpc to \textasciitilde{}20Mpc/h). At the same time, the inferred constraints on the galaxy HOD provide valuable tests of galaxy formation theory.},

We find 6 galaxies in our sample that appear to have an active AGN that is preventing on-going star-formation; this is the first time such a feedback mechanism has been observed in this mass range. Interestingly, five of these six galaxies have an ionised gas component that is kinematically offset from their stellar component, suggesting the gas is either recently accreted or outflowing. We hypothesise these six galaxies are low-mass equivalents to the "red geysers" observed in more massive galaxies. Of the other 62 galaxies in the sample, we find 8 do appear for have some low-level, residual star formation, or emission from hot, evolved stars. The remaining galaxies in our sample have no detectable ionised gas emission throughout their structures, consistent with them being quenched.

  title = {Stellar Mass Functions and Implications for a Variable {{IMF}}},
  abstract = {Spatially resolved kinematics of nearby galaxies has shown that the ratio of dynamical- to stellar population-based estimates of the mass of a galaxy (M\$\_*\^\{JAM\}\$ / M\$\_*\$) correlates with \$$\backslash$sigma\_e\$, the light-weighted velocity dispersion within its half-light radius, if M\$\_*\$ is estimated using the same Initial Mass Function (IMF) for all galaxies. This correlation may indicate that, in fact, the IMF is more bottom-heavy or dwarf-rich for galaxies with large \$$\backslash$sigma\$. We use this correlation to estimate a dynamical or IMF-corrected stellar mass, M\$\_*\^\{$\backslash$alpha JAM\}\$, from M\$\_*\$ and \$$\backslash$sigma\_e\$ for a sample of 6x10\$\^5\$ SDSS galaxies for which spatially resolved kinematics is not available. We also compute the `virial' mass estimate \$k(n,R) R\_e $\backslash$sigma\_R\^2/G\$, where \$n\$ is the Sersic index, in the SDSS and ATLAS-3D samples. We show that an \$n\$-dependent correction must be applied to the \$k(n,R)\$ values provided by Prugniel \& Simien (1997). Our analysis also shows that the shape of the velocity dispersion profile in the ATLAS-3D sample varies weakly with \$n\$: \$$\backslash$sigma\_R/$\backslash$sigma\_e=(R/R\_e)\^\{-$\backslash$gamma(n)\}\$. The resulting stellar mass functions, based on M\$\_*\^\{$\backslash$alpha JAM\}\$ and the recalibrated virial mass, are in good agreement. If the M\$\_*\^\{$\backslash$alpha JAM\}\$ / M\$\_*\$ - \$$\backslash$sigma\_e\$ correlation is indeed due to the IMF, then our \$$\backslash$Phi\$(M\$\_*\^\{$\backslash$alpha JAM\}\$) is the first estimate of the stellar mass function in which \$$\backslash$sigma\_e\$-dependent variations in the IMF across the population have been accounted for. Using a Fundamental Plane based observational proxy for \$$\backslash$sigma\_e\$ produces comparable results. The use of direct measurements for estimating the IMF-dependent stellar mass is prohibitively expensive for a large sample of galaxies. Our analysis should enable a more accurate census of the mass in stars, especially at high redshift, at a fraction of the cost. Our results are provided in tabular form.},

  abstract = {We investigate radial gradients in the recent star formation history (SFH) using 1917 galaxies with \$0.01$<$z$<$0.14\$ and integral-field spectroscopy from the ongoing MaNGA survey. For each galaxy, we obtain two-dimensional maps and radial profiles for three spectroscopically-measured parameters that are sensitive to the recent SFH: D\$\_n\$(4000) (the 4000$\backslash$AA$\backslash$ break), EW(H\$$\backslash$delta\_A\$) (equivalent width of the H\$$\backslash$delta\$ absorption line), and EW(H\$$\backslash$alpha\$) (equivalent width of the H\$$\backslash$alpha\$ emission line). We find the majority of the spaxels in these galaxies are consistent with models with continuously declining star formation rate, indicating that starbursts occur rarely in local galaxies. We classify the galaxies into three classes: fully star-forming (SF), partly quenched (PQ) and totally quenched (TQ), according to the fraction of quenched area within 1.5 times the effective radius, \$f\_Q(1.5R\_e)\$. We find that galaxies less massive than \$10\^\{10\}\$M\$\_\{$\backslash$odot\}\$ present at most weak radial gradients in all the diagnostic parameters. In contrast, galaxies with stellar mass above \$10\^\{10\}\$M\$\_\{$\backslash$odot\}\$ present significant gradients in all the three diagnostic parameters if classified as SF or PQ, but show weak gradients in D\$\_n\$(4000) and EW(H\$$\backslash$delta\_A\$) and no gradients in EW(H\$$\backslash$alpha\$) if in the TQ class. This implies the existence of a critical stellar mass, at \$$\backslash$sim10\^\{10\}\$M\$\_\{$\backslash$odot\}\$, above which the star formation in a galaxy gets shutdown from the inside out. Galaxies tend to evolve synchronously from inner to outer regions before their mass reaches the critical value. We have further divided the sample at fixed mass by both bulge-to-total luminosity ratio and morphological type, finding that our conclusions hold regardless of these factors: it appears that the presence of a central dense object is not a driving parameter, but rather a byproduct of the star formation cessation process.},

the abundance and clustering properties of dark matter halos, and the
relationship between dark matter hosts and substructures, are based on a
high-resolution cosmological simulation, the Bolshoi simulation. We
associate galaxies with dark matter halos and subhalos using subhalo
abundance matching, and perform a comprehensive analysis which
investigates the underlying assumptions of this technique including (1)
which halo property is most closely associated with galaxy stellar
masses and luminosities, (2) how much scatter is in this relationship,
and (3) how much subhalos can be stripped before their galaxies are
destroyed. The models are jointly constrained by new measurements of the
projected two-point galaxy clustering and the observed conditional
stellar mass function of galaxies in groups. We find that an abundance
matching model that associates galaxies with the peak circular velocity
of their halos is in good agreement with the data, when scatter of 0.20
$\pm$ 0.03 dex in stellar mass at a given peak velocity is included.
This confirms the theoretical expectation that the stellar mass of
galaxies is tightly correlated with the potential wells of their dark
matter halos before they are impacted by larger structures. The data put
tight constraints on the satellite fraction of galaxies as a function of
galaxy stellar mass and on the scatter between halo and galaxy
properties, and rule out several alternative abundance matching models
that have been considered. This will yield important constraints for
galaxy formation models, and also provides encouraging indications that
the galaxy-halo connection can be modeled with sufficient fidelity for
future precision studies of the dark universe.},

of galaxy-galaxy weak lensing, galaxy spatial clustering, and galaxy
number densities. Carefully accounting for sample variance and for
scatter between stellar and halo mass, we model all three observables
simultaneously using a novel and self-consistent theoretical framework.
Our results provide strong constraints on the shape and redshift
evolution of the stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) from z = 0.2 to z
= 1. At low stellar mass, we find that halo mass scales as Mh
vpropM 0.46 * and that this scaling does not
evolve significantly with redshift from z = 0.2 to z = 1. The slope of
the SHMR rises sharply at M * $>$ 5 \texttimes{} 1010
M $\odot$ and as a consequence, the stellar mass of a central
galaxy becomes a poor tracer of its parent halo mass. We show that the
dark-to-stellar ratio, Mh /M *, varies from low to
high masses, reaching a minimum of Mh /M * \textasciitilde{} 27 at
M * = 4.5 \texttimes{} 1010 M $\odot$ and
Mh = 1.2 \texttimes{} 1012 M $\odot$. This
minimum is important for models of galaxy formation because it marks the
mass at which the accumulated stellar growth of the central galaxy has
been the most efficient. We describe the SHMR at this minimum in terms
of the "pivot stellar mass," M piv *, the "pivot
halo mass," M piv h , and the "pivot ratio,"
(Mh /M *)piv. Thanks to a homogeneous
analysis of a single data set spanning a large redshift range, we report
the first detection of mass downsizing trends for both M piv
 h and M piv *. The pivot stellar mass
decreases from M piv * = 5.75 $\pm$ 0.13
\texttimes{} 1010 M $\odot$ at z = 0.88 to M
piv * = 3.55 $\pm$ 0.17 \texttimes{} 1010
M $\odot$ at z = 0.37. Intriguingly, however, the corresponding
evolution of M piv h leaves the pivot ratio
constant with redshift at (Mh /M *)piv
\textasciitilde{} 27. We use simple arguments to show how this result raises the
possibility that star formation quenching may ultimately depend on
Mh /M * and not simply on Mh , as is
commonly assumed. We show that simple models with such a dependence
naturally lead to downsizing in the sites of star formation. Finally, we
discuss the implications of our results in the context of popular
quenching models, including disk instabilities and active galactic
nucleus feedback.

  abstract = {We use the kinematics of satellite galaxies that orbit around the central galaxy in a dark matter halo to infer the scaling relations between halo mass and central galaxy properties. Using galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we investigate the halo mass-luminosity relation (MLR) and the halo mass-stellar mass relation (MSR) of central galaxies. In particular, we focus on the dependence of these scaling relations on the colour of the central galaxy. We find that red central galaxies on average occupy more massive haloes than blue central galaxies of the same luminosity. However, at fixed stellar mass there is no appreciable difference in the average halo mass of red and blue centrals, especially for M*$\lessequivlnt$ 1010.5
h-2 M$\odot$. This indicates that stellar mass is a better indicator of halo mass than luminosity. Nevertheless, we find that the scatter in halo masses at fixed stellar mass is non-negligible for both red and blue centrals. It increases as a function of stellar mass for red centrals but shows a fairly constant behaviour for blue centrals. We compare the scaling relations obtained in this paper with results from other independent studies of satellite kinematics, with results from a SDSS galaxy group catalog, from galaxy-galaxy weak lensing measurements and from subhalo abundance matching studies. Overall, these different techniques yield MLRs and MSRs in fairly good agreement with each other (typically within a factor of 2), indicating that we are converging on an accurate and reliable description of the galaxy-dark matter connection. We briefly discuss some of the remaining discrepancies among the various methods.},

  abstract = {Using a large galaxy group catalog constructed from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 4 (SDSS DR4) with an adaptive halo-based group finder, we investigate the luminosity and stellar mass functions for different populations of galaxies (central versus satellite, red versus blue, and galaxies in groups of different masses) and for groups themselves. The conditional stellar mass function (CSMF), which
describes the stellar distribution of galaxies in halos of a given mass for central and satellite galaxies can be well modeled with a log-normal distribution and a modified Schechter form, respectively. On average, there are about three times as many central galaxies as satellites. Among the satellite population, there are in general more red galaxies than blue ones. For the central population, the luminosity function is dominated by red galaxies at the massive end, and by blue galaxies at the low-mass end. At the very low mass end (M * lsim
109 h -2 M sun), however, there is a marked increase in the number of red centrals. We speculate that these galaxies are located close to large halos so that their star formation is truncated by the large-scale environments. The stellar mass function of galaxy groups is well described by a double power law, with a characteristic stellar mass at \textasciitilde{}4 \texttimes{} 1010 h
-2 M sun. Finally, we use the observed stellar mass function of central galaxies to constrain the stellar mass-halo mass relation for low-mass halos, and obtain M *,c vprop M 4.9 h for Mh Lt 1011 h -1 M sun.},

* $>$\textasciitilde{} 1010.6 M $\odot$, our results
indicate that star-forming galaxies grow proportionately as fast as
their dark matter halos while quiescent galaxies are outpaced by dark
matter growth. At lower masses, there is minimal difference in the
SHMRs, implying that the majority low-mass quiescent galaxies have only
recently been quenched of their star formation. Our analysis also
affords a breakdown of all COSMOS galaxies into the relative numbers of
central and satellite galaxies for both populations. At z = 1, satellite
galaxies dominate the red sequence below the knee in the stellar mass
function. But the number of quiescent satellites exhibits minimal
redshift evolution; all evolution in the red sequence is due to low-mass
central galaxies being quenched of their star formation. At M
* \textasciitilde{} 1010 M $\odot$, the fraction of
central galaxies on the red sequence increases by a factor of 10 over
our redshift baseline, while the fraction of quenched satellite galaxies
at that mass is constant with redshift. We define a "migration rate" to
the red sequence as the time derivative of the passive galaxy
abundances. We find that the migration rate of central galaxies to the
red sequence increases by nearly an order of magnitude from z = 1 to z =
0. These results imply that the efficiency of quenching star formation
for centrals is increasing with cosmic time, while the mechanisms that
quench the star formation of satellite galaxies in groups and clusters
is losing efficiency.},

  abstract = {We conduct a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between central 
galaxies and their host dark matter halos, as characterized by the
stellar mass-halo mass (SM-HM) relation, with rigorous consideration of
uncertainties. Our analysis focuses on results from the abundance
matching technique, which assumes that every dark matter halo or subhalo
above a specific mass threshold hosts one galaxy. We provide a robust
estimate of the SM-HM relation for 0 $<$ z $<$ 1 and discuss the
quantitative effects of uncertainties in observed galaxy stellar mass
functions (including stellar mass estimates and counting uncertainties),
halo mass functions (including cosmology and uncertainties from
substructure), and the abundance matching technique used to link
galaxies to halos (including scatter in this connection). Our analysis
results in a robust estimate of the SM-HM relation and its evolution
from z = 0 to z = 4. The shape and the evolution are well constrained
for z $<$ 1. The largest uncertainties at these redshifts are due to
stellar mass estimates (0.25 dex uncertainty in normalization); however,
failure to account for scatter in stellar masses at fixed halo mass can
lead to errors of similar magnitude in the SM-HM relation for central
galaxies in massive halos. We also investigate the SM-HM relation to z =
4, although the shape of the relation at higher redshifts remains fairly
unconstrained when uncertainties are taken into account. We find that
the integrated star formation at a given halo mass peaks at 10\%-20\% of
available baryons for all redshifts from 0 to 4. This peak occurs at a
halo mass of 7 \texttimes{} 1011 M sun at z = 0 and
this mass increases by a factor of 5 to z = 4. At lower and higher
masses, star formation is substantially less efficient, with stellar
mass scaling as M * \textasciitilde{} M 2.3 h at low
masses and M * \textasciitilde{} M 0.29 h at high
masses. The typical stellar mass for halos with mass less than
1012 M sun has increased by 0.3-0.45 dex for halos
since z \textasciitilde{} 1. These results will provide a powerful tool to inform galaxy

From these mass growth histories, we are able to measure the time at which half the total stellar mass of the descendant galaxy was assembled, \$t\_\{a\}\$, which, in order of decreasing mass corresponds to redshifts of \$z\_\{a\}=1.28, 0.92, 0.60\$ and \$0.51\$. We compare this to the median light-weighted stellar age \$t\_\{*\}\$ (\$z\_\{*\} = 2.08, 1.49, 0.82\$ and \$0.37\$) of a sample of low redshift SDSS galaxies (from the literature) and find the timescales are consistent with more massive galaxies forming a higher fraction of their stars ex-situ compared to lower mass descendants. We find that both \$t\_\{*\}\$ and \$t\_\{a\}\$ strongly correlate with mass which is in contrast to what is found in the EAGLE hydrodynamical simulation which shows a flat relationship between \$t\_\{a\}\$ and \$M\_\{*\}\$. However, the semi-analytic model of $\backslash$citet\{henriques2015\} is consistent with the observations in both \$t\_\{a\}\$ and \$t\_\{*\}\$ with \$M\_\{*\}\$, showing the most recent semi-analytic models are better able to decouple the evolution of the baryons from the dark matter in lower-mass galaxies.},

  abstract = {Bayesian parameter inference depends on a choice of prior probability distribution for the parameters in question. The prior which makes the posterior distribution maximally sensitive to data is called the Jeffreys prior, and it is completely determined by the response of the likelihood to changes in parameters. Under the assumption that the likelihood is a Gaussian distribution, the Jeffreys prior is a constant, i.e. flat. However, if one parameter is constrained by physical considerations, the Gaussian approximation fails and the flat prior is no longer the Jeffreys prior. In this paper we compute the correct Jeffreys prior for a multivariate normal distribution constrained in one dimension, and we apply it to the sum of neutrino masses \$$\backslash$Sigma m\_$\backslash$nu\$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio \$r\$. We find that one-dimensional marginalised posteriors for these two parameters change considerably and that the 68\% and 95\% Bayesian upper limits increase by 9\% and 4\% respectively for \$$\backslash$Sigma m\_$\backslash$nu\$ and 22\% and 3\% for \$r\$. Adding the prior to an existing chain can be done as a trivial importance sampling in the final step of the analysis proces.},

  abstract = {A consistent formulation to incorporate massive neutrinos in the perturbation theory of the effective CDM+baryons fluid is introduced. In this formulation all linear k dependence in the growth functions of CDM+baryons perturbations, as well as all consequent additional mode coupling at higher orders, are taken into account to any desirable accuracy. Our formulation regards the neutrino fraction, which is constant in time after the non-relativistic transition of neutrinos, and much smaller than unity, as the coupling constant of the theory. Then the "bare" perturbations are those in the massless neutrino case when the neutrino fraction vanishes, and we consider the backreaction corrections due to the gravitational coupling of neutrinos. We derive the general equations for the "bare" perturbations, and backrecation corrections. Then, by employing exact time evolution with the proper analytic Green's function we explicitly derive the leading backreaction effect, and find precise agreement at the linear level. We proceed to compute the second order beackreaction correction, and derive the leading order matter bispectrum in the presence of massive neutrinos, suggesting the squeezed limit of the matter bispectrum as a sensitive probe of neutrino mass. Notably, the generic neutrino fraction formulation in this work may be similarly applied for the consistent inclusion of massive neutrinos within any perturbative approach.},

  abstract = {We develop a higher-order perturbation theory for large-scale structure formation involving a free-streaming hot or warm dark matter species. We focus on the case of mixed cold dark matter and massive neutrinos, although our approach is applicable also to a single warm dark matter species. In order to capture the suppressed growth of neutrino density perturbations on small scales, we account for the full momentum dependence of the phase space distribution using the Vlaslov equation, and derive from it a formal closed-form nonlinear equation for the neutrino density. Using a systematic perturbative expansion of this equation we compute high-order corrections to the neutrino density contrast without the explicit need to track the perturbed neutrino momentum distribution. We calculate the leading-order total matter bispectrum for several neutrino masses. Using our result as a benchmark, we test the accuracy of the fluid approximation and a linear approximation used in perturbative and N-body analyses, as well as a new hybrid approach that combines the exact linear evolution with the nonlinear structure of the fluid equations. Aiming at \$$\backslash$lesssim1\%\$ accuracy, we find that the total matter bispectrum with a low neutrino mass m=0.046 eV can be reproduced by all but the fluid approximation, while for larger neutrino masses m=0.46-0.93 eV only the hybrid approach has the desired accuracy on a large range of scales. This result serves as a cautionary note that approximate nonlinear models of neutrino clustering that reproduce the gross features of some observables may not suffice for precision calculations, nor are they guaranteed to apply to other observables. All of the approximation schemes fail to reproduce the bispectrum of the neutrino density perturbations at better than 20\% accuracy across all scales, indicating that an exact treatment of nonlinear neutrino perturbations is necessary.},

While the dense halo environment rapidly strips subhalos of their dark mass, the compact luminous material can remain intact for some time, making the correspondence of galaxies with severely stripped subhalos unclear. Many galaxy evolution models assume that satellite galaxies eventually merge with their central galaxy, but this ignores the possibility of satellite tidal disruption. We use a high-resolution \$N\$-body simulation of cosmological volume to explore satellite galaxy merging/disruption criteria based on dark matter subhalo dynamics. We explore the impact that satellite merging/disruption has on the Halo Occupation Distribution and radial profile of the remnants. Using abundance matching to assign stellar mass/luminosity to subhalos, we compare with observed galaxy clustering, satellite fractions, cluster satellite luminosity functions, finding that subhalos reproduce well these observables on all scales. Our results imply that satellite subhalos corresponding to $>$0.2L* galaxies must be well-resolved down to 1-3\% of their mass at infall to robustly trace the galaxy population. We also explore a simple analytic model based on dynamical friction for satellite galaxy infall, finding good agreement with our subhalo catalog and observations.},

  abstract = {The cosmic accretion of both dark matter and baryons into halos is 
typically measured using some evolving virial relation, but recent work
suggests that most halo growth at late cosmic time (z$\lessequivlnt$ 2) is not
physical but is rather the by-product of an evolving virial radius
(``pseudo-evolution''). Using Omega25, a suite of cosmological
simulations that incorporate both dark matter and gas dynamics with
differing treatments of gas cooling, star formation, and thermal
feedback, we systematically explore the physics that governs cosmic
accretion into halos and their galaxies. Physically meaningful cosmic
accretion of both dark matter and baryons occurs at z$\greaterequivlnt$ 1 across our
halo mass range: \{M\}200\{\{m\}\}=\{10\}11-14
\{$\backslash$text\{\}\}\{M\}$\odot$ . However, dark matter, because it is
dissipationless, is deposited (in a time-average sense) at $\greaterequivlnt$
\{R\}200\{\{m\}\}(z) in a shell-like manner, such that dark matter
mass and density experience little-to-no physical growth at any radius
within a halo at z$\backslash$lt 1. In contrast, gas, because it is able to cool
radiatively, experiences significant accretion at all radii, at a rate
that roughly tracks the accretion rate at \{R\}200\{\{m\}\}, at all
redshifts. Infalling gas starts to decouple from dark matter at $\approx$ 2
\{R\}200\{\{m\}\} and continues to accrete to smaller radii until
the onset of strong angular-momentum support at $\approx$ 0.1
\{R\}200\{\{m\}\}. Thus, while the growth of dark matter is subject
to pseudo-evolution, the growth of baryons is not. The fact that the
accretion rate of gas on galactic scales tracks the accretion rate near
\{R\}200\{\{m\}\} provides insight into the tight relations between
the masses/sizes of galaxies and those of their host halos across cosmic
time.},

scatter of $\approx$0.2 dex. Such scaling is in remarkable agreement with the expectation of models that assume that galaxy sizes are controlled by halo angular momentum, r 1/2vprop$\lambda$R 200,
where $\lambda$ is the spin of galaxy parent halo. The scatter about the relation is comparable with the scatter expected from the distribution of $\lambda$. Moreover, I show that when the stellar and gas surface
density profiles of galaxies of different morphological types are rescaled by the radius rn = 0.015 R 200, the rescaled profiles follow approximately universal exponential (for late types) and de Vaucouleurs (for early types) form with scatter of only $\approx$30\%-50\% at R $\approx$ 1-3rn . Remarkably, both late- and
early-type galaxies have similar mean stellar surface density profiles at R $>$\textasciitilde{} 1rn . The main difference between their stellar distributions is thus at R $<$ rn . The results of this study imply that galaxy sizes and radial distribution of baryons are shaped primarily by properties of their parent halos and that the sizes of both late-type disks and early-type spheroids are controlled by halo angular momentum.},

  abstract = {Here we present the New York University Value-Added Galaxy Catalog 
(NYU-VAGC), a catalog of local galaxies (mostly below z\textasciitilde{}0.3) based on a
set of publicly released surveys matched to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS) Data Release 2. The photometric catalog consists of 693,319
galaxies, QSOs, and stars; 343,568 of these have redshift
determinations, mostly from the SDSS. Excluding areas masked by bright
stars, the photometric sample covers 3514 deg2, and the
spectroscopic sample covers 2627 deg2 (with about 85\%
completeness). Earlier, proprietary versions of this catalog have formed
the basis of many SDSS investigations of the power spectrum, correlation
function, and luminosity function of galaxies. Future releases will
follow future public releases of the SDSS. The catalog includes matches
to the Two Micron All Sky Survey Point Source Catalog and Extended
Source Catalog, the IRAS Point Source Catalog Redshift Survey, the
Two-Degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey, the Third Reference Catalogue
of Bright Galaxies, and the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty cm
survey. We calculate and compile derived quantities from the images and
spectra of the galaxies in the catalogs (for example, K-corrections and
structural parameters for the galaxies). The SDSS catalog presented here
is photometrically calibrated in a more consistent way than that
distributed by the SDSS Data Release 2 Archive Servers and is thus more
appropriate for large-scale structure statistics, reducing systematic
calibration errors across the sky from \textasciitilde{}2\% to \textasciitilde{}1\%. We include an
explicit description of the geometry of the catalog, including all
imaging and targeting information as a function of sky position.
Finally, we have performed eyeball quality checks on a large number of
objects in the catalog in order to flag errors (such as errors in
deblending). This catalog is complementary to the SDSS Archive Servers
in that NYU-VAGC's calibration, geometric description, and conveniently
small size are specifically designed for studying galaxy properties and
large-scale structure statistics using the SDSS spectroscopic catalog.

  abstract = {This paper describes the Seventh Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), marking the completion of the original goals of the SDSS and the end of the phase known as SDSS-II. It includes 11,663
deg2 of imaging data, with most of the \textasciitilde{}2000 deg2 increment over the previous data release lying in regions of low Galactic latitude. The catalog contains five-band photometry for 357 million distinct objects. The survey also includes repeat photometry on a 120$^\circ$ long, 2fdg5 wide stripe along the celestial equator in the Southern Galactic Cap, with some regions covered by as many as 90 individual imaging runs. We include a co-addition of the best of these data, going roughly 2 mag fainter than the main survey over 250
deg2. The survey has completed spectroscopy over 9380 deg2 the spectroscopy is now complete over a large contiguous area of the Northern Galactic Cap, closing the gap that was present in previous data releases. There are over 1.6 million spectra in total, including 930,000 galaxies, 120,000 quasars, and 460,000 stars. The data release includes improved stellar photometry at low Galactic latitude. The astrometry has all been recalibrated with the second version of the USNO CCD Astrograph Catalog, reducing the rms statistical errors at the bright end to 45 milliarcseconds per coordinate. We further quantify a systematic error in bright galaxy photometry due to poor sky
determination; this problem is less severe than previously reported for the majority of galaxies. Finally, we describe a series of improvements to the spectroscopic reductions, including better flat fielding and improved wavelength calibration at the blue end, better processing of objects with extremely strong narrow emission lines, and an improved determination of stellar metallicities.},

  title = {Are {{Halo}} and {{Galaxy Formation Histories Correlated}}?},
  volume = {1107},
  abstract = {The properties of dark matter halos, including mass growth, correlate with larger scale environment at fixed mass, an effect known as assembly bias. However, whether this environmental dependence manifests itself in galaxy properties remains unclear. We apply a group-finding algorithm to DR7 of the SDSS to estimate the halo mass of each galaxy and to
decompose galaxies into those that exist at the centers of distinct halos and those that orbit as satellites within larger halos. Using the 4000-A break as a measure of star formation history, we examine the correlation between the quenched fraction of galaxies, f\_q, and
large-scale environment, rho. At all galaxy magnitudes, there is a positive, monotonic relationship between f\_q and rho. We use the group catalog to decompose this correlation into the contribution from central and satellite galaxies as a function of halo mass. Because satellites are more likely to be quenched than central galaxies, the observed f\_q-rho correlation is primarily due to variations of the halo mass function with environment, which causes a larger fraction of satellite galaxies at high rho. For low-mass central galaxies (Mgal $<$\textasciitilde{} 10\^10.0 Msol/h\^2), there is no correlation between f\_q and rho. These results are inconsistent with the strong assembly bias of dark matter halos seen in this mass regime if recent galaxy growth at all correlates with recent halo growth, as we demonstrate through a high resolution N-body simulation. We also find that the mean stellar age of quenched central galaxies is independent of rho at fixed Mgal, while the formation times of low mass halos vary significantly. We conclude that the processes that halt the star formation of low mass central galaxies are not correlated to the formation histories of their host halos, and old galaxies do not reside preferentially in old halos.

  doi = {10.1086/376392},
  abstract = {We review recent determinations of the present-day mass function (PDMF) and initial mass function (IMF) in various components of the
Galaxy-disk, spheroid, young, and globular clusters-and in conditions characteristic of early star formation. As a general feature, the IMF is found to depend weakly on the environment and to be well described by a power-law form for m$>$\textasciitilde{}1 Msolar and a lognormal form below, except possibly for early star formation conditions. The disk IMF for single objects has a characteristic mass around mc\textasciitilde{}0.08 Msolar and a variance in logarithmic mass $\sigma$\textasciitilde{}0.7,
whereas the IMF for multiple systems has mc\textasciitilde{}0.2
Msolar and $\sigma$\textasciitilde{}0.6. The extension of the single MF into the brown dwarf regime is in good agreement with present estimates of L- and T-dwarf densities and yields a disk brown dwarf number density comparable to the stellar one, nBD\textasciitilde{}n*\textasciitilde{}0.1
pc-3. The IMF of young clusters is found to be consistent with the disk field IMF, providing the same correction for unresolved binaries, confirming the fact that young star clusters and disk field stars represent the same stellar population. Dynamical effects, yielding depletion of the lowest mass objects, are found to become consequential for ages $>$\textasciitilde{}130 Myr. The spheroid IMF relies on much less robust
grounds. The large metallicity spread in the local subdwarf photometric sample, in particular, remains puzzling. Recent observations suggest that there is a continuous kinematic shear between the thick-disk population, present in local samples, and the genuine spheroid one. This enables us to derive only an upper limit for the spheroid mass density and IMF. Within all the uncertainties, the latter is found to be similar to the one derived for globular clusters and is well represented also by a lognormal form with a characteristic mass slightly larger than for the disk, mc\textasciitilde{}0.2-0.3 Msolar, excluding a significant population of brown dwarfs in globular clusters and in the spheroid. The IMF characteristic of early star formation at large redshift remains undetermined, but different observational constraints suggest that it does not extend below \textasciitilde{}1 Msolar. These results suggest a characteristic mass for star formation that decreases with time, from conditions prevailing at large redshift to conditions characteristic of the spheroid (or thick disk) to present-day conditions. These
conclusions, however, remain speculative, given the large uncertainties in the spheroid and early star IMF determinations.

These IMFs allow a reasonably robust determination of the Galactic present-day and initial stellar and brown dwarf contents. They also have important galactic implications beyond the Milky Way in yielding more accurate mass-to-light ratio determinations. The mass-to-light ratios obtained with the disk and the spheroid IMF yield values 1.8-1.4 times smaller than for a Salpeter IMF, respectively, in agreement with various recent dynamical determinations. This general IMF determination is examined in the context of star formation theory. None of the theories based on a Jeans-type mechanism, where fragmentation is due only to gravity, can fulfill all the observational constraints on star formation and predict a large number of substellar objects. On the other hand, recent numerical simulations of compressible turbulence, in particular in super-Alfv{\'e}nic conditions, seem to reproduce both
qualitatively and quantitatively the stellar and substellar IMF and thus provide an appealing theoretical foundation. In this picture, star formation is induced by the dissipation of large-scale turbulence to smaller scales through radiative MHD shocks, producing filamentary structures. These shocks produce local nonequilibrium structures with large density contrasts, which collapse eventually in gravitationally bound objects under the combined influence of turbulence and gravity. The concept of a single Jeans mass is replaced by a distribution of local Jeans masses, representative of the lognormal probability density function of the turbulent gas. Objects below the mean thermal Jeans mass still have a possibility to collapse, although with a decreasing probability.

By comparing physical information extracted from the emission lines with continuum properties, we build up a picture of the nature of star-forming galaxies at z $<$ 0.2. We develop a
method for aperture correction using resolved imaging and show that our method takes out essentially all aperture bias in the star formation rate (SFR) estimates, allowing an accurate estimate of the total SFRs in galaxies. We determine the SFR density to be

(random)+0.14-0.42 (systematic)
h7010-2 Msolar yr-1
Mpc-3 at z= 0.1 (for a Kroupa initial mass function) and we study the distribution of star formation as a function of various physical parameters. The majority of the star formation in the
low-redshift Universe takes place in moderately massive galaxies (1010-1011 Msolar), typically in high surface brightness disc galaxies. Roughly 15 per cent of all star formation takes place in galaxies that show some sign of an active nucleus. About 20 per cent occurs in starburst galaxies. By focusing on the SFR per unit mass we show that the present to past average SFR, the Scalo b-parameter, is almost constant over almost three orders of magnitude in mass, declining only at M* $>$ 1010 Msolar. The volume averaged b parameter is
0.408+0.005-0.002
(random)+0.029-0.090
(systematic)h-170. We use this value to constrain the star formation history of the Universe. For the concordance
cosmology the present-day Universe is forming stars at at least 1/3 of its past average rate. For an exponentially declining cosmic star formation history this corresponds to a time-scale of
7+0.7-1.5 Gyr. In agreement with other work we find a correlation between b and morphological type, as well as a tight correlation between the 4000-{\AA}break (D4000) and b. We discuss how D4000 can be used to estimate b parameters for high-redshift galaxies.},

Survey Data Release 7, we examine in detail the specific star formation
rate (SSFR) distribution of satellite galaxies and its dependence on
stellar mass, host halo mass and halo-centric radius. All galaxies,
regardless of central satellite designation, exhibit a similar bimodal
SSFR distribution, with a strong break at SSFR $\approx$ 10-11
yr-1 and the same high SSFR peak; in no regime is there ever
an excess of galaxies in the 'green valley'. Satellite galaxies are
simply more likely to lie on the quenched ('red sequence') side of the
SSFR distribution. Furthermore, the satellite quenched fraction excess
above the field galaxy value is nearly independent of galaxy stellar
mass. An enhanced quenched fraction for satellites persists in groups
with halo masses down to 3 \texttimes{} 1011 M$\odot$ and
increases strongly with halo mass and towards halo centre. We find no
detectable quenching enhancement for galaxies beyond \texttildelow{}2
Rvir around massive clusters once these galaxies have been
decomposed into centrals and satellites. These trends imply that (1)
galaxies experience no significant environmental effects until they
cross within \texttildelow{}Rvir of a more massive host halo; (2)
after this, star formation in active satellites continues to evolve in
the same manner as active central galaxies for several Gyr; and (3) once
begun, satellite star formation quenching occurs rapidly. These results
place strong constraints on satellite-specific quenching mechanisms, as
we will discuss further in companion papers.},

preferentially quiescent star formation rates (SFR). Using a galaxy
group/cluster catalogue from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, together with
a cosmological N-body simulation, we examine the origin of this

clustering of groups/clusters, we show that central galaxies show
enhanced SFR quenching out to 2.5 virial radii beyond groups/clusters,
and we demonstrate that this extended environmental enhancement can be
explained simply by `ejected' satellite galaxies that orbit beyond their
host halo's virial radius. We show that ejected satellites typically
orbit for several Gyr beyond the virial radius before falling back in,
and thus they compose up to 40 per cent of all central galaxies near
groups/clusters. We show that a model in which ejected satellites
experience the same SFR quenching as satellites within a host halo can
explain essentially all environmental dependence of galaxy quenching.
Furthermore, ejected satellites (continue to) lose significant halo
mass, an effect that is potentially observable via gravitational
lensing. The SFRs/colours and stellar-to-halo masses of ejected
satellites highlight the importance of environmental history and present
challenges to models of galaxy occupation that ignore such history.},

  doi = {10.1093/mnras/stv1091},
  abstract = {We investigate the ability of current implementations of galaxy group 
finders to recover colour-dependent halo occupation statistics. To test
the fidelity of group catalogue inferred statistics, we run three
different group finders used in the literature over a mock that includes
galaxy colours in a realistic manner. Overall, the resulting mock group
catalogues are remarkably similar, and most colour-dependent statistics
are recovered with reasonable accuracy. However, it is also clear that
certain systematic errors arise as a consequence of correlated errors in
group membership determination, central/satellite designation, and halo
mass assignment. We introduce a new statistic, the halo transition
probability (HTP), which captures the combined impact of all these
errors. As a rule of thumb, errors tend to equalize the properties of
distinct galaxy populations (i.e. red versus blue galaxies or centrals
versus satellites), and to result in inferred occupation statistics that
are more accurate for red galaxies than for blue galaxies. A statistic
that is particularly poorly recovered from the group catalogues is the
red fraction of central galaxies as a function of halo mass. Group
finders do a good job in recovering galactic conformity, but also have a
tendency to introduce weak conformity when none is present. We conclude
that proper inference of colour-dependent statistics from group
catalogues is best achieved using forward modelling (i.e. running group
finders over mock data) or by implementing a correction scheme based on
the HTP, as long as the latter is not too strongly model dependent.},

  title = {Are {{Halo}} and {{Galaxy Formation Histories Correlated}}?},
  abstract = {The properties of dark matter halos, including mass growth, correlate with larger scale environment at fixed mass, an effect known as assembly bias. However, whether this environmental dependence manifests itself in galaxy properties remains unclear. We apply a group-finding algorithm to DR7 of the SDSS to estimate the halo mass of each galaxy and to decompose galaxies into those that exist at the centers of distinct halos and those that orbit as satellites within larger halos. Using the 4000-A break as a measure of star formation history, we examine the correlation between the quenched fraction of galaxies, f\_q, and large-scale environment, rho. At all galaxy magnitudes, there is a positive, monotonic relationship between f\_q and rho. We use the group catalog to decompose this correlation into the contribution from central and satellite galaxies as a function of halo mass. Because satellites are more likely to be quenched than central galaxies, the observed f\_q-rho correlation is primarily due to variations of the halo mass function with environment, which causes a larger fraction of satellite galaxies at high rho. For low-mass central galaxies (Mgal $<$\textasciitilde{} 10\^10.0 Msol/h\^2), there is no correlation between f\_q and rho. These results are inconsistent with the strong assembly bias of dark matter halos seen in this mass regime if recent galaxy growth at all correlates with recent halo growth, as we demonstrate through a high resolution N-body simulation. We also find that the mean stellar age of quenched central galaxies is independent of rho at fixed Mgal, while the formation times of low mass halos vary significantly. We conclude that the processes that halt the star formation of low mass central galaxies are not correlated to the formation histories of their host halos, and old galaxies do not reside preferentially in old halos.

  abstract = {We use the halo occupation model to calibrate galaxy group finders in magnitude limited redshift surveys. Because, according to the current scenario of structure formation, galaxy groups are associated with cold dark matter (CDM) haloes, we make use of the properties of the halo population in the design of our group finder. The method starts with an assumed mass-to-light ratio to assign a tentative mass to each group. This mass is used to estimate the size and velocity dispersion of the underlying halo that hosts the group, which in turn is used to determine group membership (in redshift space). This procedure is repeated until no further changes occur in group memberships. We find that the final groups selected this way are insensitive to the mass-to-light ratio assumed. We use mock catalogues, constructed using the conditional luminosity function (CLF), to test the performance of our group finder in terms of completeness of true members and contamination by
interlopers. Our group finder is more successful than the conventional friends-of-friends (FOF) group finder in assigning galaxies in common dark matter haloes to a single group. We apply our group finder to the 2-degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS) and compare the resulting group properties with model predictions based on the CLF. For the $\Lambda$CDM concordance cosmology, we find a clear discrepancy between
the model and data in the sense that the model predicts too many rich groups. In order to match the observational results, we have to either increase the mass-to-light ratios of rich clusters to a level
significantly higher than current observational estimates, or to assume $\sigma$8\textasciitilde= 0.7, compared with the concordance value of 0.9.},

  abstract = {Advances in observational capabilities have ushered in a new era of multi-wavelength, multi-physics probes of galaxy clusters and ambitious surveys are compiling large samples of cluster candidates selected in different ways. We use a high-resolution N-body simulation to study how the influence of large-scale structure in and around clusters causes correlated signals in different physical probes and discuss some implications this has for multi-physics probes of clusters (e.g. richness, lensing, Compton distortion and velocity dispersion).

We pay particular attention to velocity dispersions, matching galaxies to subhaloes which are explicitly tracked in the simulation. We find that not only do haloes persist as subhaloes when they fall into a larger host, but groups of subhaloes retain their identity for long periods within larger host haloes. The highly anisotropic nature of infall into massive clusters, and their triaxiality, translates into an anisotropic velocity ellipsoid: line-of-sight galaxy velocity
dispersions for any individual halo show large variance depending on viewing angle. The orientation of the velocity ellipsoid is correlated with the large-scale structure, and thus velocity outliers correlate with outliers caused by projection in other probes. We quantify this orientation uncertainty and give illustrative examples. Such a large variance suggests that velocity dispersion estimators will work better in an ensemble sense than for any individual cluster, which may inform strategies for obtaining redshifts of cluster members. We similarly find that the ability of substructure indicators to find kinematic
substructures is highly viewing angle dependent. While groups of subhaloes which merge with a larger host halo can retain their identity for many Gyr, they are only sporadically picked up by substructure indicators.

We discuss the effects of correlated scatter on scaling relations estimated through stacking, both analytically and in the simulations, showing that the strong correlation of measures with mass and the large scatter in mass at fixed observable mitigate line-of-sight projections.},

roughly parallels that of haloes at z $<$ 1.6. We also track the
detailed merger histories of individual galaxies and measure the likelihood of multiple mergers per halo or subhalo. We examine satellite merger statistics in detail: 15-35 per cent of all recently merged galaxies are satellites, and satellites are twice as likely as centrals to have had a recent major merger. Finally, we show how the differing evolution of the merger rates of haloes and galaxies leads to the evolution of the average satellite occupation per halo, noting that for a fixed halo mass, the satellite halo occupation peaks at z \textasciitilde{} 2.5.},

While the dense halo environment rapidly strips subhaloes of their dark mass, the compact luminous material can remain intact for some time, making the correspondence of galaxies with severely stripped subhaloes unclear. Many galaxy evolution models assume that satellite galaxies eventually merge with their central galaxy, but this ignores the possibility of satellite tidal disruption. We use a high-resolution N-body simulation of cosmological volume to explore satellite galaxy merging/disruption criteria based on dark matter subhalo dynamics. We explore the impact that satellite
merging/disruption has on the halo occupation distribution and radial profile of the remnants. Using abundance matching to assign stellar mass/luminosity to subhaloes, we compare with observed galaxy
clustering, satellite fractions, cluster satellite luminosity functions, finding that subhaloes reproduce well these observables. Our results imply that satellite subhaloes corresponding to $>$0.2L* galaxies must be well resolved down to 1-3 per cent of their mass at infall to robustly trace the galaxy population. We also explore a simple analytic model based on dynamical friction for satellite galaxy infall, finding good agreement with our subhalo catalogue and observations.},

  abstract = {Non-parametric, empirically based, models for associating galaxy 
luminosities with halo/subhalo masses are being developed by several
groups and we present here an updated version of the Vale \& Ostriker
version of this model. This is based on a more accurate, self-consistent
treatment of subhalo mass loss and revised results for the subhalo mass
function (SHMF) to address this question anew. We find that the
mass-luminosity relation, at high mass, particularly for first brightest
galaxies and less so for group total, is almost independent of the
actual luminosity function considered, when luminosity is scaled by the
characteristic luminosity L*. Additionally, the shape of the
total luminosity depends on the slope of the SHMF. For these high mass,
cluster-sized haloes, we find that total luminosity scales as
Ltot \textasciitilde{}M0.88, while the luminosity of the first
brightest galaxy has a much weaker dependence on halo mass,
L1 \textasciitilde{} M0.28, in good agreement with observations
and previous results. At low mass, the resulting slope of the
mass-luminosity relation depends strongly of the faint end slope of the
luminosity function, and we obtain a steep relation, with approximately
L \textasciitilde{} M4.5 for M \textasciitilde
1010h-1Msolar in the K band. The
average number of galaxies per halo/cluster is also in very good
agreement with observations, scaling as \textasciitilde{}M0.9.

In general, we obtain a good agreement with several independent sets of
observational data. Taking the model as essentially correct, we consider
two additional possible sources for remaining discrepancies: problems
with the underlying cosmology and with the observational mass
determination. We find that, when comparing with observations and for a
flat cosmology, the model tends to prefer lower values for
$\Omega$m and $\sigma$8. Within the Wilkinson
Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) + Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)
concordance plane of Tegmark et al., we find best agreement around
$\Omega$m = 0.25 and $\sigma$8 = 0.8; this is also
in very good agreement with the results of the cosmic microwave
background (CMB)+2dF study of Sanchez et al. We also check on possible
corrections for observed mass based on a comparison of the equivalent
number of haloes/clusters. Additionally, we include further checks on
the model results based on the mass-to-light ratio, the occupation
number, the group luminosity function and the multiplicity function.},

star-forming and quiescent galaxies to z = 4 using a sample of 95,675
Ks -selected galaxies in the COSMOS/UltraVISTA field. The
SMFs of the combined population are in good agreement with previous
measurements and show that the stellar mass density of the universe was
only 50\%, 10\%, and 1\% of its current value at z \textasciitilde{} 0.75, 2.0, and 3.5,
respectively. The quiescent population drives most of the overall
growth, with the stellar mass density of these galaxies increasing as
$\rho$starvprop(1 + z)-4.7 $\pm$ 0.4 since
z = 3.5, whereas the mass density of star-forming galaxies increases as
$\rho$starvprop(1 + z)-2.3 $\pm$ 0.2. At z
$>$ 2.5, star-forming galaxies dominate the total SMF at all stellar
masses, although a non-zero population of quiescent galaxies persists to
z = 4. Comparisons of the Ks -selected star-forming galaxy
SMFs with UV-selected SMFs at 2.5 $<$ z $<$ 4 show reasonable
agreement and suggest that UV-selected samples are representative of the
majority of the stellar mass density at z $>$ 3.5. We estimate the
average mass growth of individual galaxies by selecting galaxies at
fixed cumulative number density. The average galaxy with log(M
star/M $\odot$) = 11.5 at z = 0.3 has grown in
mass by only 0.2 dex (0.3 dex) since z = 2.0 (3.5), whereas those with
log(M star/M $\odot$) = 10.5 have grown by $>$1.0
dex since z = 2. At z $<$ 2, the time derivatives of the mass growth
are always larger for lower-mass galaxies, which demonstrates that the
mass growth in galaxies since that redshift is mass-dependent and
primarily bottom-up. Lastly, we examine potential sources of systematic
uncertainties in the SMFs and find that those from photo-z templates,
stellar population synthesis modeling, and the definition of quiescent
galaxies dominate the total error budget in the SMFs.

for star-forming and quiescent galaxies with 0.2 $<$ z $<$ 4. We
construct a large, deep (Ks $<$ 24) sample of 220 000

analysis is based on precise 30-band photometricredshifts. By comparing
these photometric redshifts with 10,800 spectroscopic redshifts from the
zCOSMOS bright and faint surveys, we find a precision of
$\sigma\Delta$z/(1 + z) = 0.008 at i+ $<$ 22.5
and $\sigma\Delta$z/(1 + z) = 0.03 at 1.5 $<$ z $<$ 4. We
derive the stellar mass function and correct for the Eddington bias. We
find a mass-dependent evolution of the global and star-forming
populations, with the low-mass end of the mass functions evolving more
rapidly than the high-mass end. This mass-dependent evolution is a
direct consequence of the star formation being "quenched" in galaxies
more massive than $\mathscr{M}$ $\greaterequivlnt$ 1010.7 -
10.9$\mathscr{M}\odot$. For the mass function of the
quiescent galaxies, we do not find any significant evolution of the
high-mass end at z $<$ 1; however we observe a clear flattening of the
faint-end slope. From z \textasciitilde{} 3 to z \textasciitilde{} 1, the density of quiescent galaxies
increases over the entire mass range. Their comoving stellar mass
density increases by 1.6 dex between z \textasciitilde{} 3 and z \textasciitilde{} 1 and by less than
0.2 dex at z $<$ 1. We infer the star formation history from the mass
density evolution. This inferred star formation history is in excellent
agreement with instantaneous star formation rate measurements at z $<$
1.5, while we find differences of 0.2 dex at z $>$ 1.5 consistent with
the expected uncertainties. We also develop a new method to infer the
specific star formation rate from the mass function of star-forming
galaxies. We find that the specific star formation rate of 1010 -
10.5$\mathscr{M}\odot$ galaxies increases continuously in
the redshift range 1 $<$ z $<$ 4. Finally, we compare our results with
a semi-analytical model and find that these models overestimate the
density of low mass quiescent galaxies by an order of magnitude, while
the density of low-mass star-forming galaxies is successfully
reproduced.
